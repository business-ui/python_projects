Certainly, the fact that the studio belongs to his father makes it an attractive (and presumably cost-effective) destination, but then Molleson is naturally at home in isolated spaces. Though he\u2019s now based in London (following an extended stint in Leeds), he spent the first 11 years of his life growing up on a tiny island in the Scottish highlands, raised in a family of folk musicians. The dark, dissonant electronic rock he creates as Makeness bears little relation to those fife-band roots, but it is nonetheless emblematic of an artist who has spent his life adapting from rural to urban spaces and back again.

Certainly, there are parallels to be drawn between Dan Snaith\u2019s evolution and Molleson\u2019s own: Makeness has followed Caribou\u2019s path from hermetic solo studio savant to ", ", and the two share a similarly soft, vaporous vocal style that infuses their productions with a vulnerable human core.

Throughout ", ", Molleson takes great care to build up his rhythmic motifs, only to do everything in his power to destabilize their foundations: He subjects the taut techno throb of \u201cGold Star\u201d to a sustained laser-beam synth attack as if trying to blow up a boss-level spaceship in a videogame, while the 4/4 thrust of the instrumental \u201cRough Moss\u201d is gradually overcome by blasts of distortion and brain-scrambling oscillations.", "Though Molleson\u2019s vocals are the most prominent feature of ", ", he\u2019s not one for in-depth lyrical narratives\u2014be it the haunted \u201cDay Old Death\u201d or the atypically playful bounce of \u201c14 Drops,\u201d he opts for minimalist phrasing and repeated incantations as if mimicking the looped vocal snippets on classic house records.

The closing \u201cMotorcycle Idling\u201d is a most unsubtle display of truth in advertising, with a thundering barrage of distorted electronics that approximates the engine rev of a chopper. Molleson has said he enjoys recording out in the country because he doesn\u2019t have to worry about pissing off any neighbors, and \u201cMotorcycle Idling\u201d is the most devious, gratuitous exercise of that freedom, with all the queasy undercurrents bubbling up throughout the record being unleashed in a dam-burst of woofer-blasting anarchy.

The final installment in this series, ", ", sees White-Gluz venturing into unfamiliar electronic territory with Kember. But while the pairing of their two sounds is unexpected, that initial surprise is about as far as the EP goes. It\u2019s tepid from start to finish, offering little that feels exciting or inspired.", "From the brusque opening of \u201cObsession,\u201d ", " sets itself up as a pulsing yet clumsy listen. The 11-minute opener begins well enough, with bass thumps building a trance beneath paranormal EQs as White-Gluz\u2019s vocals smear across the higher registers. Her voice warps itself in alluring, subtle ways across the EP: It\u2019s manipulated into a keyboard choir effect that can start or stop with the lift of a finger, gets pitched up to capitalize on its honeyed texture, and loops endlessly like a synth in the background. It\u2019s easy to forget she\u2019s contributing, though, due to Kemper\u2019s habit of getting lost in his own experimentation. While soothing and inviting at its best, his electronic ambling ends up drifting off in aimless directions on all four tracks\u2014that is, until he comes barreling back into the frame, like when the end half of \u201cObsession\u201d finally returns with a sudden, misplaced drum fill. It\u2019s as if neither artist, working remotely from their respective homes of Montreal and Portugal, felt comfortable pushing the other to refine their ideas past the rough draft stage.", "The only song that makes effective use of White-Gluz\u2019s and Kember\u2019s complementary skills is \u201cTriangle Probably.\u201d Comically, it\u2019s also the song most akin to the shoegaze sound White-Gluz hoped to ditch with this project. Chopped guitars whirl through echo pedals in a propulsive motion. In the distance, alternate vocal lines fade into focus and synths click like a spoke card on a bicycle wheel. Though it features a similarly abrupt reprise like the one in \u201cObsession,\u201d this track keeps a tighter grasp on its intentions and proposed payoffs, sounding like a true meeting of minds instead of a not-especially-necessary Sonic Boom remix of No Joy.", "Throughout ", ", you can hear White-Gluz finding the borders of her comfort zone and looking for guidance when she makes it to the other side. The trouble seems to be that Kember does little to develop her ideas once she gets there, settling instead for familiar deadpan loops. There\u2019s not nearly enough give and take to make the collaboration work. The result is an EP that feels hesitant to leap into any of the worlds it builds, however appealing they sometimes appear."]},

No song does this more effectively than the album\u2019s lead single, \u201cOom Sha La La.\u201d Here, Heynderickx likens her mental state to the decaying contents of her fridge, admits to being \u201cdoubtful of all that [she has] dreamed of,\u201d and then launches into a chorus of gleefully delivered nonsense syllables.

Much ink has been spilled on the topic of young people today, their gardens, and the perennial effort to combat existential doubt by cultivating something beautiful. Haley Heynderickx may not have a garden just yet, but if beauty can cure uncertainty, this album should be enough for now."]},

For all of its two-hour runtime, ", " barely features his trumpet, a trend already reflected in his live shows of the time. After decades of the finest pianists in jazz serving as his sidemen, Miles himself moved to the electric organ.", "Miles\u2019 organ playing didn\u2019t have the nuance, shade, and heights of his trumpet, but with the electric organ, vast new chasms opened up to him: seismic drones, durative noise blasts, a sense of deep space and foreboding void that the trumpet otherwise punctures. Dark arts arose from his keys, as Sly Stone\u2019s bassist of the time recalled during one coke-fueled night: \u201c[Miles] got on Sly\u2019s organ and started to voice these nine-note, ethereal crazy chords. Sly\u2026came out yelling, \u2019Who in the fuck is doing that on my organ? Miles, get your motherfucking ass out\u2026Don\u2019t ever play that voodoo shit here.\u2019\u201d", "Rather than run the voodoo down, now Miles could conjure it all by himself. How else to get that vertiginous, heart-strangling fear and magnificent malefic-ness of \u201cRated X\u201d? Full of dread and a speedball of drums, conga, and tabla, it\u2019s a track that plays with the ideas of no wave, post-punk, and techno at its most brusque. But Macero\u2019s editing style (dropping out the rhythm section entirely and letting the keys levitate in mid-air) also anticipates the modern horror movie aesthetic, the flickering cuts akin to the terror of an approaching tornado, bloody machete, or unmoored jet turbine. For the better part of \u201cMaiysha,\u201d Davis\u2019 keys act as breezy as any other jazz organ trio (think Groove Holmes or Big John Patton), though ten minutes in, lead guitarist Pete Cosey enters and the two hit a tone kin to electrocuting a tomcat.", "In Cosey, Miles found a sparring partner unlike any other. There had been the likes of Parker, ", ", Shorter, even McLaughlin in the past, but only Cosey could range wider and push Miles deeper, from country blues to Muddy Waters, microtonal tunings to Hendrix at his most atonal. Cosey was an imposing force with his thick shades, towering afro, and an array of pedals and synthesizers that melted futuristic noise and old ghosts together that made him demiurge to metalheads, noiseniks and punks alike. Hearing Cosey and Miles trade solos on the furious \u201cMtume\u201d is like relishing the bloody spray of each landed blow in a heavyweight fight. Miles veered in tone from lines chopped like a coke rail to higher than a chemtrail. To Cosey, the music warranted such extremes. \u201cThat music was about life,\u201d he said in one interview. \u201cIt dealt with cleansing. It dealt with rising and falling. It was extremely cerebral, but it was earthy at the same time.\u201d", "\u2019s crushing emotional gravity comes from two 32-minute pieces that are unlike anything else in Miles\u2019 catalog, much less the history of jazz, ranging from despair to rage, pride to anguish, ecstasy to abject sadness. There\u2019s the frenzy of \u201cCalypso Frelimo,\u201d which takes its name from the Mozambique political party seeking independence from Portuguese colonial rule. It sounds like a riot in the middle of a block party. Miles layers his wah-wah horn and electric organ into an ebullient Caribbean theme as Henderson holds down the low-end with Mtume and drummer Al Foster. Densely polyrhythmic yet melodically slick, with incandescent solos from Miles, Cosey and tenor saxophonist Dave Liebman race through the din. They never break away from the matrices that band lays down, they illuminate every hectic angle of it.", "For a certain generation, the triplet bass figure that Henderson drops ten minutes in feels instantly familiar. It brings up images of your childhood living room as well as a subterranean realm, so closely does it resemble Koji Kondo\u2019s theme for the underworld levels of \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d Tate calls the work a \u201cdub fugue,\u201d centering on that cavernous bass throb and a telling juxtaposition of Caribbean elements and European ones that reflects back on the title itself. The massive piece suggests a Pangaea that connects the Caribbean rhythms of reggae and calypso to African-American jazz and back to Africa herself.", "And then there\u2019s the elegy of \u201cHe Loved Him Madly.\u201d Recorded a month after the passing of ", ", its title taken from a Christmas card greeting Duke sent to Miles the year before. It both summons the ghost of Duke\u2019s \u201cjungle style\u201d big bands and anticipates the forsaken pall of dark ambient. Assembled from five separate takes, Macero wove the seemingly aimless recordings into a magnum opus, one that Brian Eno later hailed as \u201crevolutionary,\u201d finding in its half-hour descent \u201cthe \u2018spacious\u2019 quality I was after\u201d for his own future ambient work.", "It\u2019s a eulogy to Duke that seems to emanate from across the River Styx. Mtume\u2019s congas flutter like bats across the stereo field, Cosey spins out cobwebs on guitar, with Macero\u2019s spacing suggestive of a gaping void in the center of the piece. Miles looms around C-minor on organ, and when his muted trumpet finally sounds at the midway point, he channels longtime Ellington trumpeter Cootie Williams, seeming both close as a whisper and a distant wail. Erotic and ethereal at once, a second solo comes as the band starts to quicken, only to have it all turn phantasmagoric by song\u2019s end.", "Less than a year after ", "\u2019s release, Miles plunged deeper into \u201canother dark world,\u201d one where no sound escaped for the next seven years. Lurid stories abound about his reclusive, sordid, filthy lifestyle holed up in his Upper West Side brownstone during those years, as well as numerous run-ins with the law and fears of his imminent demise in the press. He had burned a bridge, one that had led him to the brink of madness. \u201cYou can\u2019t know how terrifying it is to be in the middle of all of that, it\u2019s endless sound,\u201d he confessed to one interviewer at the time. \u201cMusic is a curse.\u201d", "During that same span, his ", " bandmates also stepped away from that endless sound, instead infiltrating the realms of R&B and pop, scoring frothy hits ranging from \u201cYou Are My Starship\u201d to \u201cNever Knew Love Like This Before.\u201d Guitarist Reggie Lucas worked with a new singer named ", ", writing \u201cBorderline\u201d and producing her debut album.

Much like Sly Stone before him, Miles ventured into the heart of darkness with ", " and wrestled with the devil for his gun.

But folk songs in the traditional sense are in part defined by how they travel through culture, typically by being played in person for other people. ", " invites no such feeling of communion. These songs aren\u2019t part of a shared language that people in a room might speak to each other, they are one-way transmissions from a distant, lonely place. But the signals that come through on ", " crackle with electricity\u2014sometimes it\u2019s just a hum, and sometimes it seems like a circuit is going to explode.", "In early 1982, Bruce Springsteen was living in a rented house in Colts Neck, New Jersey, recuperating from a year-long tour following his 1980 double album ", ". His band played 140 marathon shows and were on their way to becoming one of the biggest rock acts in the world. During this period, Springsteen tasked his guitar tech, Mike Batlan, with buying a simple tape recorder so that he could tinker with some new songs and arrangements without having to bother with renting studio time. Batlan picked up a Teac Tascam 144 Portastudio, a then-new device that was the first piece of equipment to use a standard cassette tape for multi-track recording. The new machine arrived in Springsteen\u2019s life at the perfect moment, during what was arguably the most fruitful songwriting period in Springsteen\u2019s long career, one that would produce enough material for two albums (1982\u2019s ", " and 1984\u2019s ", ") with dozens of additional songs to spare. On it, he would craft what is still the most singular album in his catalog.", " remains an outlier for Springsteen, a record that sits uneasily in his discography. Instead of making an impact upon release, ", " has been accruing weight gradually over the last four decades, becoming a marker of its socioeconomic era as well as an early document of the later home-recording revolution. It stands alone partly because Springsteen didn\u2019t tour behind it\u2014his work is ultimately about his connection to his audience, and that connection is felt most intensely when he\u2019s performing onstage\u2014and partly because the record itself is kind of an accident, something that fell into place before Springsteen knew what to do with it. \u201cI had no conscious political agenda or social theme,\u201d he later wrote of this time in his autobiography, ", ". \u201cI was after a feeling, a tone that felt like the world I\u2019d known and still carried inside me.\u201d", "Springsteen\u2019s initial burst of material in Colts Neck clustered around isolation and disillusionment. There were connections to his earlier work in these new songs\u2014two tracks on ", ", \u201cStolen Car\u201d and \u201cWreck on the Highway,\u201d conveyed a similar feeling of despair\u2014but the new work was different. Springsteen seemed both emotionally closer to his characters but also less interested in judging them. These songs had no heroes and no villains, everyone in them was making their way with what they were given, every grim or brutal scene had its own context and its own internal logic.", "Early in his career, Springsteen\u2019s work thrived on personal instinct, but in isolation, it became more reliant on specific inputs. He\u2019d transform ideas he discovered in books and films and the news into frameworks for songs: the short stories of Flannery O\u2019Connor, which detailed the harsh lives of people living on the margins; Ron Kovick\u2019s ", " in which a gung-ho soldier becomes deeply scarred by the actions of his government. At some point, he saw Terrence Malick\u2019s ", " on television, a film based on the 1957\u201358 killing spree of Charlie Starkweather. The Starkweather murders were meaningless, and the randomness of that violence and inability to explain it fit with the mood of Springsteen\u2019s songwriting.", "Once the new songs recorded on the Portastudio began to gel, Springsteen selected some of his favorites, ran his simple arrangements through a Gibson Echoplex unit to add some reverb and echo, and mixed them down to a boombox he had laying around the house. He sent the tape to his manager, Jon Landau, with handwritten notes on the songs and ideas for how they might find their way on to a new record. Springsteen\u2019s letter to Landau, reproduced in his book of lyrics, ", ", suggests that the album that was emerging was mysterious even to its creator. \u201cI got a lot of ideas but I'm not exactly sure of where I'm going,\u201d he wrote. He didn\u2019t quite understand what he had, but he did feel he was entering new territory with his work.", "Springsteen carried around the cassette in his pocket as he tried to figure out what to do with his new collection of songs. The initial assumption was that his E Street compatriots would flesh them out. There were recording dates with the full band who tried to give the pieces life like they had so many other songs Springsteen had written on his own. And when that didn\u2019t work, there were sessions of Springsteen alone, trying to capture the stark feel of the original tape in a professional studio with proper fidelity. Springsteen never could recapture the atmosphere that imbued the demos; eventually, the choice was made to put it out as-is.", "The power of ", "\u2019s whole comes from Springsteen\u2019s blend of fiction and memoir\u2014some songs are personal and intimate with details drawn from Springsteen\u2019s own life, others are the stuff of novels and cinema. \u201cNebraska\u201d was Springsteen's re-telling of the Starkweather saga, and it begins, as the film does, with a shot of a young girl twirling her baton outside her house. From the innocence of this image\u2014boy meets girl in the heartland\u2014the song moves quickly and seamlessly to the narrator\u2019s description of the killing spree. The fact that we\u2019re living in a world where these things can coexist in such proximity is terrifying, and it suggests that the symbols and structures that we think exist to protect us may, in the end, offer us nothing.", "The album\u2019s violence continues. \u201cJohnny 99\u201d describes an act of murder that is the product of blinding desperation; in \u201cHighway Patrolman,\u201d a cop protects his violent brother even though doing so goes against everything he believes. \u201cAtlantic City,\u201d the only song released as a single, is a masterpiece of withheld information, a story of an out-of-luck character who is about to perform an unnamed act that he hopes will rescue his life from oblivion. Springsteen never personally experienced these scenes, but he renders them with such care and detail, he puts the listener squarely in the center of them.", "In contrast, \u201cUsed Cars,\u201d \u201cMy Father\u2019s House,\u201d and \u201cMansion on the Hill\u201d draw from Springsteen\u2019s past, particularly his complicated relationship with his father. \u201cUsed Cars\u201d and \u201cMansion on the Hill\u201d are written as memories and \u201cMy Father\u2019s House\u201d is told as a dream. But all are permeated by a deep yearning for connection, a wish that the unexpressed could be finally be spoken, and that barriers erected over a lifetime could dissolve. In the world of this record, these are the small and quiet tragedies that can nudge you down a path leading to larger and more explosive ones.", "On paper, this is Springsteen at his most novelistic, trying to get into the heads of murderers and corrupt cops, or diaristic, revisiting detailed scenes from his childhood. One writer even turned the songs\u2019 narratives into ", ". But the record\u2019s most lasting power comes not from its words or melodies but from its sound. The atmosphere in the room and the grain of Springsteen\u2019s processed voice scramble notions of a fixed time and place. To put on ", " and hear its world of echo is to enter a dream. As Bruce Springsteen songs go, these are very good ones, but their true meaning came out in the presentation.", " is above all a sonic experience, which explains why he could never get the songs right in a proper studio. \u201cA lot of its content was in its style, in the treatment of it,\u201d he said in an interview in 1984. \u201cIt needed that really kinda austere, echoey sound, just one guitar\u2014one guy telling his story.\u201d", "The atmospheric processing on ", ", the vast majority of which was imparted by the Echoplex during the mixdown stage, is crucial to the album\u2019s meaning. The slapback echo present on some of the songs conjure early rockabilly (the technique, which thickens sound by folding a slight delay onto the signal, was pioneered by Sam Phillips at Sun Studio and can be heard in all its glory on the sides ", " recorded there), and the heavy dose of reverb has been present in all kinds of music, from Bobby Vinton\u2019s \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d to any number of country hits. But rather than invoking a certain era, genre, or style, the sound of ", " brings to mind the radio, the medium through which these techniques were first widely distributed.", "The right amount of reverb and echo can make a cheap speaker in a car\u2019s dashboard sound lush and dreamy. ", "\u2019s homespun production reinforces the notion that recorded music happens across vast amounts of time and space. The guy playing and singing alone in this rented room in 1982 is connected to the person hearing it by invisible forces moving through the air. That separation, underscored by the arrangements, give the album its force.", "A few songs on the record contain references to transmissions, and these people often find themselves connected to each other in the most distant ways, often by wireless. Roads are littered with radio relay towers, radios in dark cars are choked with talk shows, a cop is called to action by the crackle of the radio. \u201cState Trooper,\u201d a song directly influenced by \u201cFrankie Teardrop\u201d by the synth-punk band ", ", is ", "\u2019s atmosphere reduced to its essence, just an ominous repeating guitar and a voice that sounds like a howling ghost. A Springsteen song like \u201cDarkness on the Edge of Town\u201d shares thematic elements with the songs on ", ", but the quiet/loud motif is designed for the stage, where Springsteen and his listeners could share in the energy. \u201cState Trooper\u201d might as well be beamed in from an orbiting satellite\u2014there\u2019s the song and then there is silence.", "\u201cState Trooper\u201d also illustrates how the automobile, central to Springsteen\u2019s work throughout his career, functions a bit differently on ", ". On ", ", the car represented escape, while on ", " and parts of ", " it was used to define boundaries, to mark the places where the dramas of life unfold. On ", ", the automobile is a kind of isolation chamber, a steel husk that keeps its passengers apart from the world. \u201cUsed Cars,\u201d a comparatively gentle song inspired by Springsteen\u2019s own life, finds a child experiencing the shame of class difference. The family is each inhabiting their own world, the father and son unable to connect and share with each other what they might be feeling in the moment. The boy knows only by what he sees, not what his father tells him; the father, consumed with his own shame, has no sense of the boy\u2019s experiences.", "Springsteen wrote that he wanted ", " to consist of \u201cblack bedtime stories,\u201d and the album almost seems to take place during one long night. Those who have jobs are working the night shift. Coming as it does at the end of the album, \u201cReason to Believe\u201d feels a bit like a sunrise. Suddenly there\u2019s a crack of light, a bit of humor; we can take a breath. The levity comes not from the details of the song, which include two shattered relationships and the death of a dog and a relative, but from the perspective of the person telling the story. Perhaps life, rather than being grim and hopeless, is merely absurd.", "In the arc of Springsteen\u2019s career, ", " is still a blip. It\u2019s an essential record in the history of home recording, but it was sort of a cul-de-sac for Springsteen himself. He has returned twice to the general format of the record, releasing the mostly solo and mostly acoustic albums ", " (1995) and ", " (2005), but neither comes close to the alchemy of ", ". This one just happened. Springsteen covers the entire episode of the record in just a few pages in ", ", and there isn\u2019t a lot to say. He wrote the songs, he put them down on a demo, and that demo became the record. It didn\u2019t sell particularly well and got no airplay. \u201cLife went on,\u201d is how he ends the section of his book on the record. And so it does."]},

Drawing on African-American voices\u2014be they famous artists or members of the Black Panthers and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee\u2014and sprinkling them atop lethargic and rote deep house (a music originating from the inner cities of Chicago and Detroit), Long ends up draining both the music and the words of their sense of urgency.

So when ", " why the band named their 15th album after ", "\u2019s epochal, deeply political 1971 LP, Kaplan\u2019s droll reply was perfectly on-brand: \u201cTo run away from your question as fast as possible, I think a lot of the things we do just feel right and don\u2019t get articulated.\u201d", "Such is the gestalt of Yo La Tengo, a band that, almost in spite of its members\u2019 encyclopedic knowledge of 20th-century music and penchant for irony, operates most effectively at the level of ", ". Self-aware enough to know the innate arbitrariness of album titles while simultaneously acknowledging the subtle power of words and names to shape the rituals of listening, Yo La Tengo\u2019s reticence to divulge it all is less rockstar mystique than generosity of spirit. Like so many of the band\u2019s lyrics, words function as decontextualized mantras, short phrases to roll around in your mind while the music gradually cocoons you. ", " is full of meditative lyrical repetition: \u201cBlow on the fire/Ashes blow away,\u201d \u201cShe may/She might,\u201d \u201cSound asleep/Counting sheep/Dream away.\u201d At a time when musicians are pushed to unpack and explain every last syllable they produce, it\u2019s a relief for one to insist on the potency of musical affects over literal definitions.", "The album\u2019s release comes in the wake of some of most volatile street-fighting since Sly\u2019s own heyday, with no guarantee that future flare-ups won\u2019t rage on for longer, at greater cost.

Consider \u201cAbove the Sound,\u201d in which Kaplan\u2019s voice emerges following three-and-a-half minutes of buzzing tribal rumble to ask, in his characteristic philosopher\u2019s whisper, \u201cWhat if we\u2019re too black and blue/To spot our latest bruise?\u201d After a year-plus of low-level fear generated by push-notification trigger warnings, the trio suggests in the song\u2019s title\u2014repeated over and again\u2014a form of sonic self-care. This specific post-traumatic calm is reminiscent of a recent episode of HBO\u2019s \u201cHigh Maintenance,\u201d in which an enterprising weed deliverer and his network of New York clients consistently express shock about some recent calamity that goes unnamed. Maybe it\u2019s the outcome of the 2016 election, maybe it\u2019s another mass shooting\u2014it\u2019s never explained, we just see reactions, and then self-medication.

There\u2019s more to the streaming metaphor than eclecticism, though: Such services are also used as mood-generating machines, trained to to facilitate calmness and sedation. In this view, ", " is possibly the moodiest Yo La Tengo album yet. It\u2019s the least song-oriented and most monochromatic LP in the band\u2019s catalog, without a Kaplan whammy-bar wild-out or a pop palate cleanser to be heard.

Your people are scattered, broken up, exterminated by alcohol, fatigue, hunger, drugs, prison\u2026 Now only they speak the language of the empire, and are not even able to understand you\u2026 they laugh at you\u2026 why do you continue to sing? You\u2019re left alone\u2026\u2019/The old man replied: \u2018If I do not sing would mean that they also took me.\u2019\u201d They haven\u2019t taken Richman yet."]},

However, just because they show Waits getting comfortable in his own skin and learning how he could present himself to his fans, these albums comprise more than simply a prelude to his remarkable run of records in the 1980s and 1990s.

It\u2019s the only song with any daylight on this otherwise night-owl collection that\u2019s set in bars and walk-ups and incorporating language he heard eavesdropping while working the door at the Heritage, a folk club on San Diego\u2019s Mission Beach.", "These are some of Waits\u2019 most composed songs, the ones that hew closest to popular forms and structures. That\u2019s not a criticism; this is just one melodic, highly structured mode that made these songs coverable by folk singers and shitty country-rock bands. They\u2019re also some of his most focused songs: \u201cI Hope That I Don\u2019t Fall in Love With You\u201d is an ode to missed opportunities, Waits never leaving his stool to tell the story of two strangers who never become anything more. Tender in its depiction of the low and the lonesome, the song is his first glimpse of this barroom milieu, which he would explore much more fully on subsequent albums. It might have sold poorly, but ", " reveals an artist who was obviously more than just another SoCal singer-songwriter.", "Released in late 1974, ", " represents a significant step forward, with Waits inching closer to his signature setting and sound. It\u2019s a concept album about the American Saturday Night and the sense of freedom or obligation or possibility contained in those hours. He\u2019s not interested in the sinner-saint/Saturday night-Sunday morning dichotomies; the morals associated with organized religion have very rarely informed his lyrics. Rather, his characters are motivated by something ineffable, unnameable: \u201cTell me, is it the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzin\u2019?\u201d he asks of no one in particular on the title track. \u201cIs it the barmaid that\u2019s smilin\u2019 from the corner of her eye? Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye?\u201d Everybody wants a little romance, a little drama, a little signal that all these late nights and early mornings, dive bars and cheap beers, desperate glances and furtive hookups might actually add up to something like a worthwhile life.", "Waits captures the melancholy but not exactly the excitement that ", " (his elder by two months) was conjuring in his similarly jazzy, relentlessly loquacious compositions around the same time. But the Boss exuded youth and all the promise contained therein; he was an optimist, a believer in the redemptive powers of rock\u2019n\u2019roll. Waits sounded old before his time, his voice deepening into a growl and his characters sloshing in their resignation. He was 25 going on 70 as he sang \u201cSan Diego Serenade,\u201d his most bittersweet break-up ballad.", "Elsewhere, he just sounds out of time. The Jazz Age saw a brief resurgence in the 1970s, thanks to movies like ", " and novels like E.L. Doctorow\u2019s ", ", but those works depict America as a font of wealth, luxury, and frivolity. For Waits, jazz conveyed deprivation and poverty, down-and-outers making the most of a few bucks and getting by on gumption and ingenuity. He convened a small band behind him, some sessions musicians who\u2019d played for Ella Fitzgerald and Count Basie, among others. They lend \u201cDiamonds on My Windshield\u201d and \u201cFumblin\u2019 With the Blues\u201d a rhythmic elasticity, a Spartan quality that reflects the details of Waits\u2019 world as ably and as convincingly as his lyrics do.", "Waits took to the road, extending his persona to the stage and refining it in front of often hostile audiences who didn\u2019t know the Tropicana Motel from the Chateau Marmont. His third album, ", ", benefits from those experiences even if it doesn\u2019t really reflect them. It\u2019s a live album, but only sort of. Waits and producer Bones Howe assembled a small audience of friends at the Record Plant in L.A., rolled out a piano and a microphone, and let Waits bend their ears for a few hours. It\u2019s not a real nightclub, more like a Hollywood film set. He introduces it as \u201cRaphael\u2019s Silver Cloud Lounge,\u201d then dives into a superlatively loose set that blurs the lines between song and stage banter. Where does his intro end and \u201cEmotional Weather Report\u201d begin? Is the eleven-minute \u201cNighthawk Postcards (From Easy Street)\u201d a real song or just a long aside to the audience?", " offers the best glimpse of Waits\u2019 world so far, and what\u2019s remarkable is the keen detail, the rich observations, and the sly turns of phrase. A street is full of \u201cused car salesmen dressed up in Purina checkerboard slacks and Foster Grant wraparounds.\u201d Eyeballing a smoky barroom he sees, \u201cStratocasters slung over the Burgermeister beer guts, and the swizzle-stick legs jackknifed over Naugahyde stools.\u201d Few songwriters make such a meal of proper nouns. Waits has a hundred different ways to describe the moon in the night sky and a thousand different ways to describe a taxicab. One is \u201cpiss yellow,\u201d another \u201cbastard amber Velveeta yellow.\u201d To see those words on a page is one thing; to hear Waits deliver them in his Satchmo growl\u2014adjusting his cadence with the timing of a stand-up comedian, deploying the word \u201cVelveeta\u201d like a raunchy punchline\u2014is something else entirely. This live/not live album is a pivotal release for Waits, one that demonstrates the depth of his world and the extent of his dedication to evoking it in fine, eccentric clarity.", "To distance himself even further from what he perceived to be the popular image of the rock star, Waits traveled from one show to the next in a jalopy, stayed in fleabags instead of luxury hotels. Rather than coke and heroin, he indulged a vice more in fitting with the world he depicted: booze. Even by his own admission, Waits drank a lot\u2014much more than this persona he was adopting demanded. That friction between him and the industry he had reluctantly joined is the theme, sometimes subtle and occasionally not subtle at all, running through his fourth album, ", ".", "The milieu is familiar, but he makes it all sound fantastical. \u201cThe Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me)\u201d is another song that sounds like it was recorded at 3 a.m. in a bar, but what sets it apart is how Waits presents the setting as nearly surreal: \u201cThe piano has been drinking, my necktie is asleep,\u201d he observes from his bench. \u201cThe telephone\u2019s out of cigarettes, and the balcony is on the make.\u201d It sounds like the world he has carefully crafted on his first three albums is unraveling at its seams. \u201cPasties and a G-String\u201d de-eroticizes its low-rent burlesque as a phantasmagoria of despair and boredom. Even \u201cStep Right Up,\u201d with Waits playing the carnival barker on some seedy midway, turns advertising slogans into dark magic.", "As wiseacre and rambunctious as that particular song may be, ", " is electrically charged with a pathos that comes across as both false and real, with Waits playing the raconteur masking his very real sadness behind expressions of sadness. \u201cBad Liver and a Broken Heart\u201d launches a counteroffensive against his congenital sentimentality, as he slyly undercuts his own pieties: \u201cThe moon ain\u2019t romantic, it\u2019s intimidating as hell,\u201d he crows. Deeply embedded in the underbelly, ", " is nevertheless Waits\u2019 most personal, even is most confessional album, somehow refracting the real person through the persona.", "It didn\u2019t take much for ", " to outsell Waits\u2019 previous albums, and it finally established him as an artist who could headline instead of support. Over the next few years, he would tour elaborate productions that occasionally incorporated fake snow and stage props. He used a cash register as percussion for \u201cStep Right Up\u201d (foreshadowing the pots-and-pans percussion on 1983\u2019s ", "). Now that he had established his particular sound, Waits set about exploring it thoroughly over the next three albums, making slight adjustments and tinkering with various sounds and styles. Strings became more and more prominent, especially on 1977\u2019s ", ". Waits\u2019 fifth begins with an instrumental called \u201cCinny\u2019s Waltz,\u201d which acts as a Technicolor overture for the songs that follow.", "The tracks are austere, usually just Waits and a piano. Still, these are some of Waits\u2019 most cinematic compositions, both musically and lyrically. \u201cI Never Talk to Strangers,\u201d a duet with ", ", sounds like a rehash of \u201cI Hope That I Don\u2019t Fall in Love With You,\u201d and \u201cA Sight for Sore Eyes\u201d plumbs the same nostalgia as \u201cMartha,\u201d among other songs. But Waits stretches out on the album\u2019s second side, spinning wild yarns about hitmen and hitchhikers.", "Waits always borrowed heavily from Hollywood, not only its grandiose soundtracks but also its neglected glamour and noir tableaux. In 1978, he took his first role in Sylvester Stallone\u2019s ", ", as a piano player named Mumbles. It wasn\u2019t a stretch; the character was based loosely on him to begin with. Later, \u201cI Never Talk to Strangers\u201d would inspire Francis Ford Coppola to write and direct 1981\u2019s ", ". So it\u2019s fitting that Waits opens ", " with \u201cSomewhere,\u201d from Leonard Bernstein and ", "\u2019s ", ". The song, like the musical, began onstage but was soon translated to the big screen, which parallels the trajectory Waits himself was taking. It must have seemed like an odd cover choice at the time, and Waits gives an odd performance by rounding his vowels and flattening the ends of his words into hisses and moans.", "On the other hand, \u201cSomewhere\u201d makes perfect sense thematically: His characters may be hard up, but they\u2019re still dreaming about that promised \u201cplace for us.\u201d \u201cChristmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis,\u201d a minor hit at the time and a fan favorite for decades after, is one of Waits\u2019 most devastating tunes. He sings in the voice of the title character as she describes a happy life to an old friend: She\u2019s married and off the dope, pregnant and hopeful. Someone might have stolen her record player, but \u201cI think I\u2019m happy for the first time since my accident.\u201d The last verse arrives like a punch in the gut, as she admits she\u2019s making it all up before asking to borrow some dough.", "That Minnesota sex worker may be Waits\u2019 richest character, a dreamer who spins an elaborate yarn that even she doesn\u2019t have the heart to maintain. If women have stayed at the margins of his world, usually playing strippers and molls and closing-time hook-ups and more generally serving as fuel for his very masculine sentimentality, here Waits gives a woman a starring role and manages to create a deeply complex and contradictory character. His voice might sound low and gruff, but his performance isn\u2019t mannered or distracting. Rather, he\u2019s deeply sympathetic, especially as he reveals her very modest dream: \u201cI wish I had all the money we used to spend on dope,\u201d he muses. \u201cI\u2019d buy me a used car lot and I wouldn\u2019t sell any of \u2018em. I\u2019d just drive a different car everyday dependin\u2019 on how I feel.\u201d", "In the context of Waits\u2019 nearly fifty-year career, 1980\u2019s ", " is often discussed as a transitional album, a pivot away from the jazzier settings of his Asylum records and toward a much wilder and weirder mode. And certainly there are clear signposts pointing the directions he would head in the new decade. But in the context of this reissue series, ", " sounds less like a transition and more like a goodbye to those back alleys and underbellies, those barrooms and speakeasies that he once inhabited so easily. On subsequent records that setting would be much less prominent, so it\u2019s fitting that \u201cIn Shades\u201d is an instrumental, a smooth, organ-led interlude saturated with nightclub chatter and silverware clatter. Waits himself is missing from the milieu, as though he has fled the scene already. And he ends the album with \u201cRuby\u2019s Arms,\u201d one of his tenderest compositions. It\u2019s his goodbye to a lover he leaves before the sun comes up, something like a prequel to \u201cOl\u2019 55\u201d that brings everything full circle. But it\u2019s also a goodbye to every barfly and every hoodlum and every itinerant on some \u201cinebriational travelogue\u201d he\u2019s met along the way. \u201cI will leave behind all of my clothes I wore when I was with you,\u201d he sings. And then he ends the album with a fond farewell as he rides off into the sunrise: \u201cAs I say goodbye\u2026 I\u2019ll say goodbye.\u201d", "Bon voyage, as well, to the grizzled persona he inhabited throughout the 1970s. No longer a cult figure, he had become what you could reasonably call successful, the music industry bending to him rather than him accommodating its demands. But perhaps the most significant change\u2014the one that really took him out of himself\u2014came in 1978, on the set of ", ", when Waits met screenwriter Kathleen Brennan. In addition to becoming his songwriting partner, she inspired him to sober up and to expand the sound and scope of his music. \u201cI didn\u2019t just marry a beautiful woman,\u201d he told ", " in 2006. \u201dI married a record collection.\u201d He would never again be quite as prolific as he was in the 1970s\u2014seven albums in seven years\u2014but he would never again be truly alone again in a song."]},

For one thing, you might have noticed that lead singer and chief songwriter Ray Davies was establishing himself as a ", "\u2014an auteur\u2014at a time when the Beatles were still addressing themselves to teenagers and the Rolling Stones still working their way through the Chess back catalog.", "Ray could and did address teenagers, but he primarily dwelt in an adult world, so adult that it comprised the dead past as well as the drab present. He addressed potentially everybody (at least everybody in the United Kingdom; he made no concession to American listeners and their points of reference). He was sometimes taken to task for condescension to his subjects, but although he could stiffly upbraid a well-respected man, he clearly felt deep sympathy and compassion for the woman who bought a hat like Princess Marina, and the tenants on Dead End Street, and the little mortgage-holder of Shangri-La, which might not be much but at least has indoor plumbing.

Your mods would have seen relics of the scene sharing stages with the forebears of beat music Cliff Richard and the Shadows. Music hall is not a style or a genre as much as it is an enormous circus tent, which takes in the demonically earworming sing-songs of the 1890s, the ragtime that started coming in around 1910, the various jazz forms that arrived after the Great War, children\u2019s songs, saloon-bar ballads, patriotic anthems, and the often dark and even noir lounge-crooner styles that prevailed during the 1930s.

And even though this was a time when the musical vocabulary was expanding dramatically and rock\u2019n\u2019roll had receded to become merely one of a vast selection of stylistic possibilities, the word that popped up in almost every contemporaneous review of ", " was \u201cnostalgia.\u201d", "What is nostalgic about ", " is something that runs far deeper than mere style. As much as ", " was concerned with ruin and failure, this album is about loss; the passage of time hovers over every cut. The loss is personal, historical, societal, existential, even anticipatory. While the momentum of change was sweeping across Western society, gathering the steam that would result in a wave of abortive revolutions the following year, four guys in their early 20s were meditating on the transience of all things. They don\u2019t seem especially reactionary about it\u2014they do remain hippie mods, after all. And they are not protesting change, at least not yet; their attitude toward the historical past is rather more nuanced. The so-called Little Englanders that are evoked tend toward the pathetic: the easily-mocked conformist (\u201cTin Soldier Man\u201d), the man whose life is systematically destroyed by his mother-in-law (\u201cSituation Vacant\u201d), the degenerate smokers in \u201cHarry Rag\u201d (which is rhyming slang for \u201cfag,\u201d as in cigarette).", "Even the paragon David Watts, the schoolboy hero character, does not quite exemplify the Edwardian ", " verities.

But it is \u201cDeath of a Clown,\u201d a rare collaboration by Ray and his brother Dave, that truly tolls the bell for the demoted ex-empire. The lions and tigers have given up, the fleas have deserted, no one bothers to get their fortunes read anymore, so we might as well break up the crown.", "An even deeper loss is inscribed in \u201cTwo Sisters,\u201d a memorial to the sacrifice of autonomy. The single sister looks into her mirror on a rising note, the married sister into the washing machine on a falling one; among triumphal chords, the married sister imagines her sibling\u2019s liberty, then muted resolution arrives as she regards her children. An analogue to the carefree party-going single sister (who turns up in various guises in the Kinks\u2019 repertoire, e.g. \u201cPolly\u201d and \u201cBig Black Smoke\u201d) can perhaps be glimpsed in Dave\u2019s \u201cFunny Face,\u201d her \u201cpill-shaped eyes\u201d now blurred behind frosted hospital glass, access to her forbidden by doctors, and although Dave is insistent that she\u2019s \u201call right,\u201d we don\u2019t entirely believe him.", "At this point, Ray is still tinkering with the Tin Pan Alley dictum that every song be required to accommodate romance, but he is doing increasingly odd things with the assignment. \u201cNo Return\u201d is a bossa nova, the last word in middle-class drinks music, evocative of sandy beaches bestrode by young women in colorful wraps, but it casts its heartbreak in the subjunctive (it begins with the word \u201cif\u201d). It only broaches the declarative in its non-bossa nova bridge with few quintessentially Ray bars that appear like a parenthesis. \u201cEnd of the Season\u201d superficially pretends to concern itself with lost love, but it\u2019s really a portrait of a rich twat who has been cast into the cold by time, too old for the \u201cchicks\u201d and too right-wing for clubland. Ray affixes an audible pencil mustache, pushes his larynx upward to achieve a croon, and lets fall the crocodile tears. \u201cLazy Old Sun\u201d romantically teases the listener with its gliding notes, double-tracked answering lines, and fervent chorus, but, like Mayakovsky and Frank O\u2019Hara, Ray is literally addressing the sun. As he once said, it\u2019s a joke, but it\u2019s also not.", "But true love does appear, resoundingly, on the record\u2019s concluding number and hit single, \u201cWaterloo Sunset.\u201d American listeners perhaps did not appreciate that Waterloo is a large and not terribly picturesque train station, but they instinctively understood how the song binds together the ordinary and the transcendent. For all the talk about how Terry and Julie were Terence Stamp and Julie Christie in ", ", they were fill-ins (\u201cI wanted to use the names Bernard and Dorothy,\u201d Ray claimed to Jonathan Cott in 1970). \u201cWaterloo Sunset\u201d is a hymn to the kind of workaday beauty that lies beneath notice but can hold its own in the cosmos. It makes the heart swell, and unlike most such pop songs does not turn out to consist mostly of corn syrup. Coming at the end of this album of romantically buoyant mourning, \u201cWaterloo Sunset\u201d is both immediate and far removed, forever contemplating its loss even as it celebrates its actuality."]},

But, as the critic Hilton Als wrote in his 2003 essay \u201cWhite Noise,\u201d it didn\u2019t matter to Eminem. \u201cMathers never claimed whiteness and its privileges as his birthright because he didn\u2019t feel white and privileged,\u201d Als wrote. It\u2019s interesting, though, that Eminem never negated his masculinity or heterosexuality, two identities that were and, more or less, remain intrinsic to the success of male rappers. His privilege meant that he could shed his racial signifiers and become a ghost, a psychopath, a loving father, a bigot, a clown. So why do fans believe any of this?

He casts himself as the obsessed fan, Stan, and fires off three letters to himself with escalating severity until we find out that, having drawn inspiration from Slim Shady, Stan kills his own pregnant wife and himself in a car crash.

As the song ends, Elton John trots out to meet Eminem centerstage. They embrace. Mathers glares impudently at the audience, as if the hug were a provocation on its own, as if deeming to touch John in public somehow proved something to his critics. It was a feckless, empty gesture born of a basic bigot\u2019s misunderstanding: How can I be a homophobe with a gay friend? But during Eminem\u2019s imperial year, these objections were drowned out by the roar of the crowd.

This kind of despondency can be fertile artistic ground, but de Jong doesn\u2019t, well, do that much with it, preferring to wallow in the mire. From time to time he\u2019ll jump into action and bring in some movement with high-speed scalar runs or a deft turnaround, but these accents and asides feel like the spasms of energy that punctuate an otherwise crushing depression.", "The two tracks that most overtly succumb to those blank, closed-circuit comforts of despondence are respectively the strongest and weakest on the album. \u201cPipe Dream\u201d offers four and a half minutes of low-key synthesizer bells that drift without melody, momentum, or apparent development; it\u2019s the only time where de Jong lays back and lets the music do the talking. As unambitious as a day spent hiding in bed, it nonetheless engages in a way nothing else on ", " does. But at the close of the LP, \u201cBreaking Up\u201d attempts a cringeworthy confrontation. A woman screams snippets of dialogue atop some inconsequential noodling. \u201cThere\u2019s a girl in a bed,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re disgusting\u201d give way to \u201cMad, mad, mad, mad\u2026 sad or glad\u201d and \u201cGood better best.\u201d Hardly harrowing, these feel less like catharsis than a drunken tantrum from next door, or a sub-par student theater group. Suddenly we\u2019re back in college, but de Jong is no longer the super-smart, shroomy Derrida fan across the hall. Looking at the title again, one wonders who he thinks the \u201csucker\u201d is? Is it de Jong, the victim of some unnamed and devastating deception, or is it others who are able to see hope where he sees only despair? Either way, having brought us into the heart of his darkness, we\u2019re left with precious little to guide us back into the light."]},

With \u201cWhen the Horses Were Shorn of Their Hooves,\u201d the drama arrives in earnest. Carlson\u2019s guitar is agitated and irascible, the riff practically showing its teeth and shaking its fists. Something very bad is bound to happen.

Then, at last, there\u2019s an escape from danger to the halcyon coast, beautifully rendered in \u201cReaching the Gulf.\u201d Carlson\u2019s guitar seems to smile as it sighs, as our hero licks wounds that could have been much worse.

The album suggests a full story, but it still seems paradoxically fragmentary. After its slow burn fades, after our hero has returned home, what\u2019s best about ", " might be the sense of possibility it poses. Having scored an actual Western film with minimal guitar vignettes, here he has shaped his amplifier worship into an auditory Western largely for solo guitar.", "So what\u2019s next in that stepwise process? A through-composed score for a big-budget Western or an actual Cormac McCarthy adaptation? Perhaps, but it\u2019s more tantalizing to imagine Carlson taking the trail of fellow guitar hero ", ", who has turned ", " or ", " into fully realized, entirely immersive stage shows. Here\u2019s a free idea for an expensive production for any ambitious arts presenter, then: Commission Carlson to fully realize his 21st-century Western.

", " from 1967 and ", " from the following year were inventive blues-rock records, but Beefheart had bigger ambitions. At that point, his group the Magic Band were a mostly democratic collective, and since Beefheart had less musical expertise than his colleagues, his odder suggestions were vetoed as too unconventional. \u201cThat really pissed him off,\u201d said bassist Gary Marker. \u201c[Because] he had all these ideas in his head and he had no way of getting them across to people.\u201d", "To gain the control he needed to express his vision, Beefheart morphed the Magic Band into a kind of musical cult. In mid-1968, he replaced some members of the group with younger, more impressionable players (guitarist Bill Harkleroad and bassist Mark Boston were each just 19), gave everyone a nickname to match his own, and holed up with them in a house on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The sessions in the house have since become a crucial part of rock legend, the subject of contradictory stories and much myth-making. By many accounts, Beefheart imposed weird lifestyle rules and played mind games that bordered on brainwashing. Some claim the musicians couldn\u2019t leave the premises save for a weekly grocery trip, and drummer John \u201cDrumbo\u201d French said he spent one month eating only a cup of soybeans every day.", "Beefheart put a piano in the house\u2014despite not knowing how to play it\u2014and banged out ideas, which French transcribed and assembled into tunes. The resulting pieces were more like puzzles than songs, giving different instruments conflicting time signatures and varying part lengths that had to somehow meet at specific points. French compared it to building a solid wall with bricks of unequal size. This unorthodox complexity forced the Magic Band to rehearse 12 hours or more a day, usually without Beefheart. Often they would sleep right where they had just practiced, and immediately continue upon waking.", "After six months of this bunkered mania, the Magic Band entered a studio with Beefheart\u2019s friend ", ", who \u201cproduced\u201d them by staying out of the way. Riding the adrenaline of their intense woodshedding, the group recorded 20 songs in less than six hours. Beefheart added vocals separately, syncing uncannily with the music despite rarely having rehearsed with the band and eschewing headphones during takes. In less than a week, after adding two tracks from an earlier session and a few more made at the group\u2019s house, ", " was born. As Third Man\u2019s new reissue makes clear, this 28-song double album might be the strangest record in major-label rock history. Beefheart made more accessible music before and after, but his most difficult work is still his most famous, defining his musical legacy and the sound of the Magic Band for going on five decades.", "Its enduring place in the canon is due in part to the allure of ", "\u2019s singular logic.

After all, capturing its sound would mean somehow retracing the steps from Beefheart\u2019s enigmatic brain to French\u2019s devout hands to the Magic Band\u2019s inhuman toil.", "The thrill of ", " also lies in the boggling assemblage of stylistic and thematic strands. There are shards of rock and blues in the band\u2019s deconstructed grooves; free jazz in Beefheart\u2019s primitive, ", "-inspired saxophone playing; literary surrealism in his obscure yet oddly resonant lyrics; outsider folk in his growled a capella songs; and postmodern collage in the album\u2019s diverse sound sources, which include field recordings, spoken skits, studio banter, and even vocals recorded over the phone.

Though Beefheart\u2019s lyrics were mostly oblique conundrums, he could also be bluntly topical, singing boldly about the Holocaust and the Vietnam War.", "And though Beefheart could be pathologically controlling with his bandmates, he was surprisingly open to chance and accident throughout ", ". He left in the sounds of the tape player pausing in his acapella songs, inserted recordings of himself wandering the weeds into others, included mistakes and under-breath commentary in pre-song skits, and created one spontaneous track, \u201cThe Blimp,\u201d by having guitarist Jeff \u201cAntennae Jimmy Semens\u201d Cotton call Zappa and read him a poem, which Zappa recorded while his own band, the Mothers of Invention, played in the background.", "Perhaps most surprising is how catchy ", "\u2019s jagged songs turn out to be. Some even have verses and choruses, albeit filtered through the band\u2019s sonic contradictions and Beefheart\u2019s skewed timing.

That\u2019s even clearer in this remaster, sourced not from the decayed original masters but from less-worn backups. But was the music worth what Beefheart put the Magic Band through? French and Harkleroad have both said that though they wouldn\u2019t want to endure it all again, they were thrilled to have created such a landmark. They certainly deserve more credit than they got from Beefheart, who often claimed to be the sole songwriter (he even left French off the original album credits completely, apparently as punishment for leaving the band before it was released). But luckily each member\u2019s vital contribution is loud and clear in every note, beat, and weird and wonderful turn.

Here DOOM delivers his most sprightly verse on the album over a grimy bassline, even offering a few flashes of his once razor-sharp lyricism (\u201cNo friendly warfare, this ain\u2019t wrestling/There\u2019s nothing staged over here, you\u2019re trippin\u2019, mescaline\u201d). \u201cPhantoms,\u201d the record\u2019s highlight, is even more successful overall. The Czar-Keys beat here is surprisingly modern, building a groove out of bubbly 8-bit chirps that collapse halfway through the track, revealing a chasm of groaning synths below. DOOM kicks things off with a competent but forgettable verse, Deck spits furiously, landing a few satisfying lines (\u201cStared death in the face, left him with a sore neck\u201d) and even Esoteric, the weakest rapper of the bunch, shows up with a surplus of energy.

But none of its verses are particularly notable: DOOM is mealy-mouthed, Esoteric leans more on references than ability, and Deck\u2019s verse, while dynamic, feels simplistic (\u201cI stay woke like seven cups of coffee\u201d). On \u201cDon\u2019t Spoil It,\u201d Deck stuffs his bars with references to classic rap albums, but the song feels more pandering than clever.

Czarface has always spoken directly to a specific audience, one that values familiarity over progression. And if what you\u2019re looking for is a hip-hop album that ", " like it could have been recorded 15 years ago, ", " certainly delivers. Everything from the production to the corny pulp-movie skits feels frozen in time.

I was a child then, at the time of album\u2019s release, and \u201cThe Bottle,\u201d an intoxicating track about the dangers of alcohol, was a radio and dance floor hit.

Despite it sounding exactly how you\u2019d expect, the fact that they are releasing their eighth album in 2018 is a respectable accomplishment in and of itself, especially when you consider the tribulations they\u2019ve faced just over the past decade: the backstage death of bassist Robert Levon Been\u2019s father in 2010 and, more recently, the slow yet determined recovery of drummer Leah Shapiro from a Chiari malformation that affected her balance and rhythm.", " is, of course, more of the same, but at least it\u2019s more of the same in a fairly compelling way.

The remarkable thing about King Gizzard\u2019s 2017 isn\u2019t just that they managed to release five records\u2014it\u2019s that not a moment of them felt half-assed. They didn\u2019t cook the books by dropping a 30-minute improv jam or cobbling together a bunch of acoustic song sketches and calling it an album. Whether it was released by a big label like ATO, a small Aussie indie like Flightless, or, well, ", ", each of their 2017 releases is an elaborately constructed, carefully considered statement that opened up new universes for the band to explore.", "A title like ", " might suggest a sloppy collection of leftovers, but the record features some of the most delicately rendered songs ever released by this bull-in-a-china-shop band.

Keyboardist Ambrose Kenny-Smith\u2019s atypically relaxed voice leads the way on the gently swinging cocktail-lounge pop of \u201cThe Last Oasis,\u201d gradually submerging the song in a blissful, aquatic whirl. And the dreamy, psychedelic soft-rock of \u201cBeginner\u2019s Luck\u201d is so enchanting, you could be forgiven for thinking its scenes of high-stakes casino gambling constituted a celebration of excess, rather than a cautionary allegory for unchecked greed. (The spastic, squawking guitar solo that overtakes the song in its final minute brings the band\u2019s subversive intent to the fore.)", "As \u201cBeginner\u2019s Luck\u201d makes clear from the outset, ", "\u2019s tilt toward pop accessibility doesn\u2019t come at the expense of the band\u2019s burgeoning social conscience.

Over a rumbling ", " groove, the self-explanatory \u201cGreenhouse Heat Death\u201d finds ringleader Stu McKenzie singing of environmental degradation from the Earth\u2019s perspective in the pained croak of a torture victim. And the growling \u201cGreat Chain of Being\u201d would verge on heavy-metal parody if only its megalomaniacal ravings (\u201cI usurp the precious stones/I have come to take the throne/I transcend the natural flesh/I will lay your god to rest\u201d) didn\u2019t resemble dispatches from the Oval Office. Even the band\u2019s clarion call for off-the-grid living, \u201cMuddy Water,\u201d is rendered as a sax-blasted blitzkrieg boogie, as if to suggest that our time to enjoy nature\u2019s spoils is rapidly running out.", "But if there\u2019s a song here that best sums up the events of the past year\u2014for both the band and the world at large\u2014it\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Sleepin\u2019 In.\u201d In its downsized, vacuum-sealed sound and slumberous spirit, it\u2019s a worthy successor to the pantheon of ", " songs about getting ", " ", ". And like those tunes, it\u2019s less a slacker\u2019s anthem than a cry for help, a plea to disconnect from the pressures of the outside world. \u201cI need to locate the switch hidden in me/Which will turn me off,\u201d McKenzie sings. Given that he\u2019s just released five musically and ideologically dense albums in 12 months, dude has more than earned the right to power down."]},

Go-to Atlanta producers like TM88, Goose, and Yung Lan dot the landscape with tracks that sound smooth but not slick, and often take shape out of minor key atmospherics. Glizzy uses the same sounds to channel opulent romance (\u201cBlow a Bag\u201d) and morbid existentialism (\u201cTake Me Away\u201d), sometimes on the same song. \u201cGet Away\u201d is a versatile escapist anthem: crime chase and sentimental runaway at once.", "Glizzy has also rekindled his surefire working relationship with the Atlanta producer ", ", whose keyboard twinkles on \u201cOne Day\u201d might echo some of his previous productions (see ", "\u2019s \u201cPeacoat\u201d), but remain vital enough to appear on both this album and the producer\u2019s own recent solo outing. For all the Atlanta stars Zaytoven\u2019s beats have canvassed, Glizzy might treat them the best. He slips into the first verse with droning couplets and jumps out of the second to yelp out his bona fides. For the chorus, he churns hope into a mantra, promising and reminding himself of the purpose of his grind: \u201cAll my niggas gon\u2019 ball one day.\u201d", "Besides the smartly streamlined curation of beats, ", " also folds in carefully doled out features: ", " carries a swaggering hook on \u201cDope Boy Magic\u201d and ", " punches into \u201cGet It Again\u201d with a relentless string of brags. As the de facto leader and concentrated star power of the D.C. crew Glizzy Gang, Shy shares space with 3 Glizzy and 30 Glizzy on \u201cHaters Anthem\u201d for a track that greets envy with biting inspirationalism. But there\u2019s a sour side here too. In September, 30 Glizzy ", ", and his brief appearance on the ", " tracklist prefaces a heartfelt tribute at the end of the album. That closer, \u201cTake Me Away,\u201d is dangerously morose, edging into depressive suicidal thoughts as Glizzy caps off each chorus line with an open invitation for death. Glizzy sounds both like an open-wound and depressed shut-in here. \u201cIt\u2019s a war started outside, don\u2019t wanna talk about it,\u201d he yelps. For all the giddiness Glizzy carries onto many of his songs, he\u2019s never been more endearing than this, wallowing in justifiable street survivalism.

Like the rest of their bandmates, the saxophonist, drummer, and keyboardist came from different New York City high schools, and the York College Blue Notes band was offered to them as a networking platform and artistic incubator\u2014an opportunity for serious, guided jamming. They ran with it. By 2014, with Williamson, Benitez, and others at his side, Barr founded ", " as a fluid and open-door ensemble of his own.", "In the time since, the group has plastered themselves across the city as a ubiquitous and modular live jazz band.

As a live act especially, Onyx Collective\u2014sometimes as spare as that original trio, but often hovering around a half dozen\u2014has become many things to many scenes. Now, a group of musicians that can\u2019t sit still seem to be figuring out what it means to be a recorded band.", "In 2016, teaming with the online radio platform KNOW-WAVE and the streetwear brand Supreme, Onyx Collective released a full-length debut of live recordings called ", ". Their follow-up, their first music available digitally, is a series of three releases destined for the British label Big Dada, and so far they too have been conduits for the band\u2019s traveling live act. The first two EPs, ", " and ", ", stitch together tracks recorded at a variety of locations across the city. The sleepily psychedelic \u201c172 Forsyth St.\u201d is named after the former KNOW-WAVE storefront radio station where Barr concretized and catalyzed the formation of Onyx Collective, and also where many of the ", " songs were recorded. As a result, the first ", " EP\u2014the better of the two\u2014feels like a tributary time capsule to the band\u2019s recent formation.

For both better and worse, this stretch of tracks in particular\u2014the first five from the second EP\u2014feels especially like being in the room with the band. Even when he\u2019s holding back, Williamson\u2019s kit crashes over every song at this location, sometimes just so, but too often overzealously. On both \u201cSteam Rooms\u201d and \u201cSkate Park,\u201d you can almost hear him loosen his grip, and the space between strikes is both funky and refreshingly breathable, like someone has opened the door to allow the room some outside air. On the first EP, his drums have a lighter and less imposing touch.", "Whether shaped by their location or permitted by it, Onyx Collective\u2019s lasting charm is in their jam band fluidity. They often adopt an aggressive but playful bebop stance, whirling through changes with Williamson\u2019s taps and splashes urging them forward. They can also channel their surroundings into serene cityscapes or quiet meditations, like on the final tracks of ", ". (\u201cEyes Closed\u201d sounds like closed-door respite, Barr finally tucking away from the city bustle into silence so that he can breathe deep and longingly into his sax, alone except for the faint, growing hum of a background bassline.) Elsewhere, they lean into funky jam sessions. \u201cMambo Pancakes\u201d is a swampy salsa burner that juts out of the tracklist, Barr\u2019s saxophone relegated not to solo duties as much as rhythmic core. \u201cFruit Stand\u201d sounds like a dainty free jazz romp, a half volume lullaby next to some of the more boisterous jams.", "Through it all, these tracklists feel less invested in fleshing out a linear live experience as they are in bottling up vignettes from the field. In that way, Onyx Collective sound like a group in motion, seeping into and out of spaces, self-leveling into place each time. For both better and worse, some of the tracks on the ", " EPs sound as much like the room as the band, the city as muse and canvas at once."]},

Harsh though its front-end may be, \u201cDrum Dance\u201d exudes joy throughout its 12-plus-minute runtime.

Wiley used a limited (if hugely distinctive) sonic palette on his eski recordings, leaning heavily on the Korg Triton\u2019s Gliding Squares preset along with percussive clicks, clinks, and stomps that were rumoured to be taken from a Nintendo \u201cIce Hockey\u201d game (but which FACT later located on E-mu\u2019s Planet Phatt unit).

The celestial electronic experiments of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop also feel like an influence: the astral synth effects on tracks like \u201cDelvaux\u201d and \u201cHorizon\u201d could easily have soundtracked \u201cDr. Who\u201d\u2019s excursions into the icy darkness of outer space.", "In 2008, Zomby had only been on the scene for a short while, and here he introduces some of the production quirks that would mark his later output.

This is music that feels handmade, not machine-painted, loose rather than quantized, and the effect is head-spinning, full of shifting themes that fracture, dissolve, and remold like ice sculptures refreezing in new and unsettling shapes.

These elements come together on the wonderful \u201cWaterfall of Ice,\u201d which combines an eerily beautiful, proto-\u201cStranger Things\u201d melody with a moody descending bass riff, \u201cice puck\u201d clicks, and a lone, angry hi-hat hiss.", " is both naggingly familiar and singularly odd.

The alias \u0442\u043f\u0441\u0431 is apparently an abbreviation for \u201c\u0442\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0435,\u201d or \u201cDark Past Bright Future\u201d\u2014a name that Servolenko, via Gregor, says he likes for its ambiguity.

Murky drones float like oil slicks atop layer upon layer of sampled and programmed drums; new-age keys veil indistinct scraps of dialogue.

Layered phrases fall where they may, and short loops repeat with the nagging insistence of a stuck MPC pad. Just as ", " is said to compose his music using a rudimentary audio-editing program, these drifting scraps of synths, drums, and field recordings don\u2019t sound like they required much CPU power to put together.

The opening track, \u201cCatching Rare Birds,\u201d begins with looped congas, choral pads, and tentative electric bass tones before an imposing acid squelch seizes control; it has as much in common with 4AD as it does ", ". The similarly hybrid \u201cWalking Distances\u201d is a kind of gothic dancehall, and even the B side\u2019s more uniformly white-knuckled tracks sound like approximations of jungle by someone who had read extensively about the genre without ever having heard a lick of the real thing.", "In the closing \u201cAre You Still Hurt,\u201d the record\u2019s heart-in-mouth climax, tight loops of wordless vocals and short bursts of breath weave a wheezy web above craggy breaks and savage drum programming. The whole thing is suspended between furious energy and weightless rumination. Just like the moments of dangerous fatigue referenced in the title, the music acts out a kind of surrender, where you don\u2019t know where you are and you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going. It\u2019s a portrait of motion, plain and simple, of free falling through empty space, and no mystery\u2014and, conversely, no ultimate reveal, should it come to that\u2014can rob this music of its immediacy."]},

Though he hasn\u2019t performed this massive piece in many years and he has never considered it finished, it is possible to quantify some moments on its timeline. After Young conceived \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano\u201d in 1964, a decade passed before he performed it in concert, and another 13 years went by before he released a commercial recording. The work itself, which he\u2019s played in public over 60 times, takes him up to six hours to execute on a piano that needs a \u201cminimum of a few weeks\u201d to be tuned and ideally remains in its exact location for three months before a concert. The first commercially available recording, a 1987 five-disc box set on Gramavision documenting his 55th performance of the piece in 1981, lasts a little over five hours.", "But how long does it take to understand \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano\u201d? Judging by all the literature and analysis surrounding it, the answer could be \u201cforever.\u201d Young\u2019s own notes are long, detailed, and deeply technical. They include a four-page list charting the exact times of over 400 \u201cThemes, Chordal Areas, and Durations,\u201d which bear titles as basic as ", " and as fanciful as ", " and ", ". Many others have attempted to explain \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano\u201d too, the most monumental effort being Kyle Gann\u2019s 30-page 1993 essay in ", ", which mapped out its inner workings using numbers and graphs. The mere idea of listening to a five-hour piece of music is daunting enough. But immersion in the legend of \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano\u201d reveals it to be not just a work of art, but a complex mathematical and philosophical system, one to which scholars could devote whole lifetimes.", "Despite the piece\u2019s staggering reputation, there is at least one simple idea at its heart: Specific sounds can create specific feelings. Young came upon this idea through his obsession with \u201cjust intonation,\u201d the tuning system on which he based the composition. Most pianos are \u201cwell-tempered,\u201d meaning each note is slightly off-center so that all 12 musical keys can be played. Young\u2019s version of just intonation, by contrast, is more exact, with the intervals between each string following rigid whole number ratios. It\u2019s difficult to tune a piano this precisely, which is why the process starts well in advance of the performance, and why Young usually plays on specially-modified pianos. As he put it, \u201cThe manner in which I play the piece, and how well, is directly inspired by the nature of the tuning.\u201d", "But the goal of \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano\u201d is less technical precision than emotional expansion. \u201cIt seems to me that each harmonically related interval creates its own unique feeling,\u201d Young says in his box set notes. \u201cThrough this system we can, first, catalogue each feeling with its corresponding rational number, and then actually create, store, and retrieve, and finally and most importantly, repeat the feeling, relative to the musician\u2019s ability to tune the intervals.\u201d Even further, because \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano\u201d uses novel and rarely-heard intervals, it could potentially upend conventional notions of which emotions different keys produce. Young suggests it could even induce feelings that have never before been felt in response to music.", "The musical path that led Young to \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano\u201d was a kind of avant-garde roller coaster. He studied jazz saxophone at UCLA, soon playing with such stalwarts as ", " and ", ". As a graduate student at Berkeley, he experimented with tape and electronic music pioneers ", " and ", ". He moved to New York in 1960 to study with the groundbreaking avant-garde composer of chance music ", ", later creating conceptual compositions in conjunction with George Macunias\u2019 Fluxus movement (which included ", "). In the mid-\u201960s, Young delved into long, sustained tones with the Theater of Eternal Music, birthing a new movement that would soon be known as Minimalism. That group included future ", " member ", " and multi-media experimentalist ", " (whose math expertise helped lead Young toward whole numbers and just intonation). In the late \u201960s, just a few years after he conceived of \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano,\u201d Young and his partner ", " encountered the work of Pandit Pran Nath, whose perfectly in-tune singing and the emotions it elicited changed Young\u2019s life.", "Much of this personal musical history poured into various sections of \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano,\u201d which began life in 1964 as a 45-minute improvisation in Young\u2019s New York loft. Though the piece constantly evolved over the next decades, some portions date as far back as when Young improvised on his grandmother\u2019s piano as a teenager. His studies of other composers influence numerous passages, including some with explicit titles like ", " and ", ". And his extensive multicultural knowledge played a heavy role. Young felt his tuning system helped him access the feelings associated with \u201cthe modes of such ancient classical systems as the musics of Greece, Persia, the Indian subcontinent, and the Far East,\u201d offering him \u201can infinite universe of eventual possibilities.\u201d", "Perhaps most importantly, Young\u2019s playing in \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano\u201d is an extension of his early saxophone work. The piece begins in the key of E-flat, which he first grew accustomed to on his E-flat sopranino sax. In the \u201960s, he devised a method of playing his horn so fast that it sounded like he was creating sustained chords rather than flurries of notes. Young translated this technique to his piano, concocting \u201cclouds\u201d of sound, or as he put it, \u201cextraordinary periodic acoustical beats [that] became suspended in the air like a cloud over the piano.\u201d This is perhaps the most emotionally affecting aspect of \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano.\u201d When Young\u2019s notes coalesce into whirlwinds, dazzlingly alien sounds emerge. \u201cThe flow of momentum marshaled the vibrations of air in the room, slowly making the ear aware of sounds that weren\u2019t actually being played,\u201d Gann reported from one performance. \u201cThe play of combination and difference tones created astounding aural illusions.\u201d As a result, Gann was convinced that Young was singing\u2014though he never did\u2014and also thought he heard bells, foghorns, and machinery.", "While Minimalism is often more about hypnosis than engagement, \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano\u201d is enthralling and rarely a \u201cdifficult\u201d listen. Young\u2019s playing is filled with dramatic changes, moving ambiance, and cinematic swells. As critic Robert Palmer wrote, \u201cUnlike much of the work of the academic avant-garde, it is music that asks to be experienced, that seeks to produce an immediate, deeply felt sensation.\u201d Even when he repeats notes for long stretches, Young creates compelling beginnings, middles, and ends. There are lots of stories inside \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano.\u201d", "Of course, whether anyone can actually be fully engaged by anything for five straight hours is almost unanswerable. The very concept of absorbing one piece of music for that long seems absurd, requiring a new conception of what it means to listen to an album, much less to just simply listen. Though I\u2019ve owned a CD copy of \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano\u201d for over a decade, I\u2019ve only once found the time to hear it all in one sitting, following along with Young\u2019s roadmap the whole way. I\u2019m not sure how often I was focused completely on the music\u2014I\u2019m not sure the word \u201cfocus\u201d even has meaning here\u2014but I do remember how striking the piece\u2019s circular arcs were when heard all together. \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano\u201d is distinctly about themes and variations, filled with tensions, climaxes, and resolutions.", "That sets it apart from the more static and repetitive work of ", ", ", ", and much of the Minimalism movement of which Young is often cited as a father. As Gann puts it, \u201c...while both Minimalism and Serialism aim for music devoid of memory or anticipation, Young plays Wagner-like, with constant suggestions of themes past and present.\u201d Gann even insisted this piece shouldn\u2019t be called minimal\u2014his ", " review was titled \u201cMaximal Spirit\u201d\u2014although Young was apparently happy to use that name. Ultimately, \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano\u201d sits between traditions and movements. It\u2019s equally possible to hear it as a repetitive work erasing the concept of time, as a narrative in which ideas emerge, dissipate, and return in progressing cycles or an unclassifiable hybrid that feels static and moving at the same time.", "The diversity and richness of \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano\u201d come not only from Young\u2019s innovative tuning and compositional structure but from his improvisation. He always performed the piece from memory, without a written score. He saw each chance to play it as an opportunity to advance it, making it a living, unending composition. With each public iteration, he added new sections and changed existing ones. (The piece was well-suited for such expansion: At one point in the 1970s, two major portions were added when Young simply changed one note of his tuning). \u201cI get no satisfaction unless the piece grows,\u201d he once said.", "Its evolution might seem irrelevant when listening to a single fixed recording. But this version that was released\u2014which Young titled to include the show\u2019s date and start and end times\u2014was, in fact, one of his most improvisatory. Though he claims that \u201cI would [always] follow the dictates of my muse, no matter how extreme,\u201d Young usually played with a clock at his side, so not to spend so long on any one section that he\u2019d run out of steam for the rest. But during the October 25, 1981, performance, he left the clock at home and was surprised afterwards to find that what usually took him three to four hours to play lasted over five. He called it \u201cnot just the longest, but most imaginative and creative realization of \u2018The Well-Tuned Piano\u2019 that I have yet played.\u201d A few years later, he claimed that the piece had grown so much that no single performance could contain it all.", "With only one other recording to compare it to (a harder-to-find DVD of a 1987 performance, released by Young\u2019s own MELA Foundation), it\u2019s hard to judge if this version is the most imaginative. But it certainly feels remarkably present and immediate, as if Young has discovered and inhabited an infinite, ever-expanding moment. Moods change rapidly given the piece\u2019s scope, and even when he\u2019s traversing slower, quieter passages, tension courses. Often the drama comes not just from its arcs and shifts, but also from the sense that at any moment something new\u2014or something that you haven\u2019t heard in a while\u2014lies just around the corner. That something new might even be a feeling, an emotion familiar yet uncannily novel, tweaked into an outer realm by Young\u2019s devout interval-shifting. If any five-hour work can keep you on the edge of your seat, this is it.", "That sounds almost like a magic trick, and it\u2019s tempting to assign a mystical aura to \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano.\u201d Many of Young\u2019s other projects\u2014with their references to dreams, and in the holistic experience of his New York space The Dream House\u2014suggest his creative approach has a spiritual aspect. But when writer Ian Nagoski expressed surprise that Young\u2019s devotion to just intonation wasn\u2019t about the harmony of the spheres, Young replied, \u201cI really work with sound as it appears in the real world.\u201d By doing so, he discovered profundity in concrete things: mathematical equations, thought-out structures, individual sounds as direct catalysts for individual feelings. He found a way into the core of music and its effect on the listener through exacting methods, accessing a reality no other artist ever had, simply by tuning and playing piano in his own singular way. Which means one simple statement he made sums up \u201cThe Well-Tuned Piano\u201d perfectly: \u201cEqual temperament reminds one of the truth; just intonation is the truth.\u201d"]},

Either way, the bail got paid, and Pac was locked into a three-album contract with Death Row.

The anger that simmered in Tupac through his time in Clinton was stoked by Suge, by the assassination attempt, by the press and his rivals. Where Pac\u2019s earlier work had described the experiences of those who were fleeing the law or the feds or death, now all those things were rendered in the first person. On October 12, 1995, Pac was released from jail. He flew to Los Angeles and immediately started recording. On his first night out, he cut one song called \u201c", ",\u201d a heartfelt elegy for an incarcerated friend finding Islam, and regards the growing distance between them with a mixture of pain and pride. But there was another song from that first madcap session, something sparse and sinister that would eventually ", " the album. He starts it in a whisper: \u201c", "\u201d", "~~", "At the height of its power, Death Row operated out of Can-Am Studios, a complex in Tarzana, Calif., just over the hills from L.A. All that Suge surveyed was red: the walls, the couches, the chairs. On the floor was a red carpet, with the label\u2019s logo outlined in white; the understanding was that no one could tread on the logo, a residual superstition from Knight\u2019s days as a defensive end in Division I football.", "From the moment he landed in California, Tupac wrote and recorded at an incredible pace. Some artists who worked alongside him during this period, like ", ", later suggested that this was so Pac could quickly satisfy his contract with Death Row and leave the label. It\u2019s also possible he simply felt the clock ticking on his time as a free man. By 1996, that fatalism had begun to engulf nearly all of Pac\u2019s writing; he was also keenly aware that he was out on bail, and a return to prison was a very real possibility.", "Whether or not the Nate Doggs of the world were right about Pac wanting to burn through his Death Row obligations, there\u2019s something almost Old World about the relationship Tupac traced between art and money. This is a superstar who was relying on expense money to eat, someone whose temporary freedom had been granted, magnanimously, in exchange for his art.

I was gonna start digging into these niggas\u2019 chests right?\u201d) until the climactic \u201cTell the cops to come and get me,\u201d there\u2019s barely a pause, certainly never a second thought.", "Pac\u2019s greatest strength as a writer was his ability to isolate emotions: to identify them within himself, to evoke them in listeners, and to convincingly ascribe them to the characters he rendered, be they imaginary Brendas or caricatured ", ". While he was an endlessly complex individual, Pac liked to choose one gut feeling and blow it up to its technicolor extreme\u2014never to the point where it became unbelievable, but he had little interest in hedging himself or tacking on qualifiers. On ", ", that impulse, combined with the pace and method and recording (and with his legal situation, and with his mounting paranoia), made for an alchemic blend of horror, fate, and defiance.", "During the sessions he was an omnivore, swallowing up sounds from his youth or his periphery, borrowing the syntax of those who floated in and out of Can-Am, distilling his collaborators\u2019 most painful life stories for 30-second cameos.

The first comes from the album\u2019s phenomenal post-production and mixing. Sixteen of the 27 beats are credited to either Daz or Johnny \u201cJ,\u201d each of whom delivers a career-defining performance. But ", " benefits greatly from ", ", who was forced, due to contractual red tape, to work mostly under his government name, David Blake. Only \u201cHeartz of Men\u201d is officially a Quik beat, but the Compton legend did a significant amount of mixing and remixing. As varied as the sounds themselves are, the album has a uniformity of texture, and elegies like \u201cLife Goes On\u201d and larks like \u201cCheck Out Time\u201d foreground their shared DNA.", "Pac\u2019s relationship with Dre never gelled like Suge had hoped. Dre had planned to use a solo version of \u201cCalifornia Love\u201d as his next lead single, but Suge\u2019s edict that the best work of every Death Row artist be cannibalized for Pac\u2019s album tabled that idea indefinitely. So ", " is in the curious position of having its lead single included only as a remix with an entirely different beat. Though Dre\u2019s other contribution to the album, the ", "-assisted disc-two opener \u201cCan\u2019t C Me,\u201d is a highlight, the musical chemistry far outpaced their personal bond.", "The other element that helps connect all these disparate threads is Pac\u2019s increasingly singular rapping style.

But on ", ", the component parts of his formula\u2014voice, cadence, mixing, energy\u2014cohere into something powerful, accessible, but inimitable. To go back to \u201c2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\u201d: Listen to the interplay between Snoop\u2019s silk and Pac\u2019s sandpaper, one rapper slipping over the beat, the other clawing his way through it. The 21st-century notion that Tupac was an unexceptional technical rapper is absurd; some of his simplest approaches require incredibly powerful performances. He was a master of mounting tension, giving full dimension to words that would fall flat with from the mouth of anyone else.", "That clarity of style and identity allows ", " to spiral out in the grimmest and most lighthearted directions without ever losing its focus. And so there are moments like the end of \u201cAll About U\u201d where Snoop, curled up in a bathrobe, flips through the channels and cross-compares the Million Man March with Montell Jordan videos, but five songs later, Pac lets \u201cNo More Pain\u201d bludgeon the listener into a sort of hollow hypnosis. The sugary \u201cThug Passion\u201d slides right into the sober \u201cPicture Me Rollin,\u201d \u201cI Ain\u2019t Mad at Cha\u201d into the incomprehensibly filthy \u201cWhat\u2019z Ya Phone #.\u201d", " is just as political as Tupac\u2019s first two albums, which dealt with national politics in more overt terms. Pac\u2019s writing is inherently and inescapably political, and his feelings about prison, about race, and about America permeate nearly every verse. On songs about video models, he slips in lines like \u201cLife\u2019s hell for a black celebrity.\u201d Take this to its logical end: \u201c", ",\u201d the gleefully sleazy single with K-Ci & JoJo, features a mid-song tangent about Bill Clinton, Bob Dole, and C. Delores Tucker. For Tupac in 1996, sex would inevitably be wrapped up with politics and freedom.", "The sexual abuse conviction that landed Pac in Clinton Correctional Facility has been documented exhaustively. In November 1993, Tupac and several associates of his sexually assaulted a woman in a New York hotel. A year later, he and his road manager were convicted of first-degree sexual abuse. (Each was acquitted on related sodomy and weapons charges.) Tupac was sentenced to one and a half to four and a half years in prison, with the possibility of parole after the first 18 months.", "Through the trial, Pac adamantly maintained his innocence. While the case is the subtext for much of ", ", he addresses it head-on only in fleeting moments (\u201c", "\u201d). What\u2019s curious about ", " is that Tupac raps so ravenously about, well, fucking. Two of the first three songs are about sex, and the fifth is \u201cHow Do U Want It\u201c; then there\u2019s \u201cPhone #,\u201d the conceit of which is \u201chere\u2019s a lot of phone sex.\u201d It is defiant and it is tone-deaf; it is baiting those who believed the charges and it is an attempt to will something out of existence.", "All of it was of a piece with personal feuds and paranoias. When \u201cHow Do U Want It\u201d was pushed as the album\u2019s third single, one of its B-sides, the anti-Bad Boy screed \u201cHit Em Up,\u201d became perhaps the most famous diss track of the \u201990s.

Someone asked him about his name. He talked about a man named Tupac Amaru II, who in 1780 led a revolt against Spanish colonists and what was effectively an economy of slave labor that exploited the native populations. In the centuries since, the uprising has been mythologized by some of those fighting for indigenous rights or independence throughout Latin America; in his own time, Amaru was marred by rumors of his uneven control over the rebels, with stories of brutal looting and violence dirtying his reputation and eroding support.", "Eventually, two of his officers betrayed him, and he was captured. He was sentenced to watch his wife, son, and other relatives be executed, after which he was to be drawn and quartered in the town square. His tongue would be cut out and his severed head would be displayed on a stake.", "Pac talked about this\u2014the revolution, the betrayal, the execution. Then he composed himself. \u201cPeople ask me what my name means, and I don\u2019t tell \u2019em like Tupac Amaru,\u201d he said. \u201cI just say it means \u2018determined,\u2019 because I\u2019m determined to never, ever negotiate again.\u201d", " was likewise without compromise\u2014an exhaustive survey of Tupac\u2019s brain matter at the most harrowing time in his young life.

Tucked into the back half of the second ", " disc, \u201cPicture Me Rollin\u2019\u201d is that proverbial eye of the storm. Pac opens the song rapping about frayed nerves and federal surveillance, then cedes the floor to CPO and Big Syke for several minutes.

During the second half of the track, the pianist swaps out her pointillistic noises for some gentler clouds of minimalist repetition. Her arrangement allows this unusual sequence of sounds to hover over chilled-out rhythm section grooves. On paper, such pairings may seem abrupt or ill-matched, but the skill of this band resides in the way it makes unlikely reversals seem second-nature.", "Courvoisier\u2019s piece \u201c\u00c9clats for Ornette\u201d offers a nod to the late composer and saxophonist ", ". In its early seconds, a short, excitable theme bursts out. Traces of the same figure can also be heard in some of Courvoisier\u2019s most out-there stretches, during a subsequent solo. Since Coleman was a widely beloved pioneer of new ecstatic styles in the avant-garde, you can\u2019t invoke his name in a title without some risk.

Her music was so idiosyncratic, even, at times, solipsistic. Responding to those qualities early in her career, Artforum called her \u201ca woman who clearly spends a lot of time in her apartment with the shades drawn.\u201d And reviewing her 2012 album ", " the last released before she signed to 4AD, Pitchfork said of U.S. Girls that \u201cyou can tell without peeking at the liner notes that this is a project born of solitude and isolation.\u201d", "But by the time her 2015 record, ", " came out, Remy had begun to open the band to external voices. And three years later, U.S. Girls has become a cacophony. ", ", at once the most accessible and sharply violent U.S. Girls album to date, is the product of more than two dozen collaborators, many of them members of the Toronto funk and jazz collective the Cosmic Range. Not a single song was written by Remy alone; two were even written without her input. And yet, the glam and surf rock, disco and pop, (glorious, danceable pop!) on the record speaks to a unified vision, one of spit, fury, and chuckling to keep from crying.", "Though it is unmistakably a record about women\u2019s anger in its various shades and forms, Remy signals her awareness of male canons throughout (its title comes from ", " and the song \u201c", "\u201d is a clear reference to ", ".) Those landmark texts are there to be turned inside out: Remy is interested in creating new mythologies, fertilizing stale old ground to nurture a different sort of harvest. The shuffling funk of \u201cPearly Gates,\u201d for instance, turns a story of ", " into a religious allegory, asking how a heaven controlled by men could ever be safe.", "That might sound to some like a facile observation. But none of the songs on ", " can be folded neatly into a box. Remy remains a narrative savant wedded to the thrill of the unexpected, the razor under the tongue, and she fills her songs with cryptic passages and unexpected allusions. Making a record without psychological depth (or music fit to accompany it) might cause her to break out into hives. The album\u2019s first track, the foreboding, psychedelic \u201c", "\u201d sets up a woman\u2019s revenge tale. With its breathy ad-libs and spiraling, almost-Western cinematic synths, it would slot nicely into the soundtrack of ", ", and it includes that most phallic of all musical passages, the guitar solo. The song, co-written with Remy\u2019s husband, the musician Max Turnbull, begins in media res: \u201cYou\u2019ve been sleeping with one eye open because he always could come back, ya know? And you\u2019ve been walking these streets unguarded waiting for any man to explode.\u201d It ends (spoiler alert!) with a woman instructing another on how to ensure that her male target is dead.", ", too, is nominally a revenge tale. But just as revenge becomes a portal to the many layers of Shakespeare\u2019s play, so too do does ", " soon migrate to more complex scenarios. On the extraordinary \u201cRage of Plastics,\u201d Remy explores, with sax and surf guitar, the bubbling resentment of a woman whose job at an oil refinery has made her infertile. And good luck solving the riddle contained within the funky dirge \u201cL-Over,\u201d a song about ditching a mysterious lover, an animate being with no heart. With few exceptions, these are stories about how women react after being done wrong. But the reactions are so varied that it feels as if each belongs to a different individual, and the album comes to feel like an entire community in tense conversation with itself.", "The musical vocabulary of U.S. Girls has also become so expansive that it can be difficult to pin down. There are flashes of ", " and ", ", \u201970s psychedelia and ", "\u2019s ambient extravaganzas, but new to Remy\u2019s palette is a disco-driven pop, stoking a wild celebratory spirit barely restrained by traditional verses and choruses. \u201cIncidental Boogie,\u201d \u201cRosebud,\u201d and most especially \u201cM.A.H.,\u201d the album\u2019s spiritual and intellectual centerpiece, glow with the spirit of ", ", or ", " with bayonets concealed under those flowing white robes. Remy has talked about pop as a form of bait, to draw listeners in to her more complex ideas. \u201cM.A.H.\u201d barely disguises an anthem of righteous anger directed toward an old romance. \u201cAs if you couldn\u2019t tell, I\u2019m mad as hell,\u201d she sings in her wiry alto. \u201cI won\u2019t forget so why should I forgive?\u201d She\u2019s used the best, catchiest song on the record, you come to realize, to rail against an unlikely antagonist: Barack Obama.", "Because Obama, for Remy, is just another avatar of male authority, the kind that she takes on without scruples. On \u201cM.A.H.\u201d she accuses the 44th president of fraudulence, charming half a country while continuing to wage its wars and eavesdrop on its citizens. Remy spelled her more broad skepticism of political power out in a ", ", around the time she had embarked on making the record. \u201cThe violence that women experience on an individual basis from other individual men, in my mind it mirrors the violence that\u2019s going on around the world,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same as the police brutality that\u2019s happening in the States, it\u2019s the same as the bombing of the Syrian people.\u201d In telling the story of her relationship with Obama as a bad romance, she underscores the way that the most casual forms of male misbehavior are political. And on ", ", Remy lives within their violence for 37 minutes, seeding it with her own ideas and the sounds of camp and disco records. Thirty-nine years after tens of thousands of people attended the ", " at Comiskey Park in Chicago, it\u2019s as if she\u2019s staged an album-long counterprotest, bringing the artifacts of the patriarchy to the stadium and burning them to ash.", "The characters of ", " exist far from a comfortable echo chamber. Their rage may be understandable, and expressed through Remy\u2019s songs, but, as the album closes, her songs become skeptical, cautious, pensive, and even meditative. The album comes to resemble something like a time-spanning mirror. It anticipates the full range of the conversation that\u2019s been raging in public since October, the complicated, multi-faceted and nuanced exchange that the opponents of the #MeToo movement keep pleading for, ", ". Each of its songs evokes an individual voice, an individual woman, an individual context and though their stories burn in different colors, each contains an ember of catharsis, a feeling that lasts throughout the album. It is the rare political pop record that looks toward the future and offers us something new."]},

The horns swell and the polyrhythms rumble not with a distant awe, but with a believable intimacy; the reference point isn\u2019t the mere ", " of Africa, but all of what that idea encompasses. In a spectacular way, G\u00f6ransson\u2019s score captures the multiplicity of the fictional country of Wakanda.", "\u201dWakanda\u201d\u2014which plays when the hero, the Black Panther T\u2019Challa, prepares to take his throne in the film\u2019s opening act\u2014offers a glimpse into that sort of specificity. T\u2019Challa begins the movie as an inheritor of a new kingdom who feels the magnitude of his deceased father\u2019s legacy, and in this vulnerable moment, Senegalese musician Baaba Maal solemnly cries a song that serves as a metaphor for the fallen king. G\u00f6ransson isn\u2019t simply ticking off the diasporic boxes; he\u2019s rooting them in an emotional context. The sadness adds gravity to the piece\u2019s later half: Regal brass decorates a wide shot of Wakanda, signifying the glory he\u2019ll have rule over.", "The movie\u2019s main villain, Erik Killmonger, is given that same amount of care and development. Not only is he a foreigner to the nation despite his familial ties; his worldview barely intersects T\u2019Challa\u2019s, who puts his loyalty to his nation over Killmonger\u2019s desire to empower black people outside of the continent. The piece of music named after him embodies the inner conflict that drive his actions. The tambin flute appears as a ghostly presence, its windy notes puncturing with the urgency of an ancestral cry from the afterlife. But the theme resolves with trap hi-hats that now dominate hip-hop. The change-up and its familiarity re-centers Killmonger as an African-American, whose generations-old plight pits him against Wakanda\u2019s isolationism.", "So when Killmonger brings these elements with him to Wakanda, he becomes the disruptor.

Killmonger\u2019s venomous out-of-placeness is further harped on as we see him cooly marching toward the throne, as the camera flips upside down and the hi-hats rollick once again.

The most significant example is that string phrase that rises in parts of \u201cAncestral Plane\u201d\u2014an emotive section that expresses a tension and surrender, like a fist unclenching in divine humility. That theme is featured when T\u2019Challa visits the mythical ancestral plane as part of his ritualistic duties as the new king. When he gazes at the beautiful, purple-hued universe, the music helps the audience share in his reverence but it never feels like it\u2019s manufacturing that emotion.", "It\u2019s a testament to G\u00f6ransson that he gives the score\u2019s most resounding moments over to the African diaspora.

The thing about surviving an attempt to take your own life is that it is often framed as a failure, on the other side of which is your responsibility to continue to endure living. I am mostly saying that Scarface has his own relationship with death. Yes, he grew up poor and black and among violence. Yes, he knew what it was to kill as a survival tactic, but he also nearly couldn\u2019t find his way to surviving himself. When Scarface raps about killing, it is with a fine lens, with nuance and haunting detail.

It, like him, walks a multi-layered line. His voice is a fashioned brass instrument, a horn played by a rusty but enthusiastic student. He bellows like a hustler turned preacher, or a preacher turned hustler, or anyone familiar with the corner and the pulpit in equal measure. He has a voice that commands attention, which allows him to unfurl his narratives patiently, with the full ears of any listener.

J Prince, the head of Rap-A-Lot Records, told Scarface that there was a ghetto in every city, and therefore, he had to make an album that would resonate in the ghettos of every city. At that point, Houston wasn\u2019t an unknown commodity in rap, but it wasn\u2019t New York or Los Angeles.

Every ghetto isn\u2019t the same, but Scarface seemed to know that the missing link in all of these ghettos was conversations about the frightening nature of how to survive them. What was being offered on ", " was a mental escape route.

They needed to cut records for a production demo, and Butterfly suggested they use an old Dread Poets Society song called \u201cSkin Treatment.\u201d With the blessing of Doodlebug\u2019s old group mates, Digable combined the song with another called \u201cBrown Baby Funk,\u201d a fusion that birthed \u201cRebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat),\u201d the unfadable jazz rap record that won the group a Grammy and put them on the map. With both local jazz and rap clubs backing the single, the airplay-boosted cut continued to build momentum. They didn\u2019t set out to be a \u201cjazz rap\u201d group; they simply made use of available resources, sampling what was around them and being as creative as their circumstances would allow. Their raps reflected their respective worlds merging: Butler\u2019s jazz roots, Irving\u2019s street savvy, and Viera\u2019s cross-cultural identity.", " is an album about freedom\u2014from convention, from oppression, from the limits imposed by the space-time continuum. It envisions slick rhythms and grooves as emancipation from the natural order of the physical universe; as Ladybug Mecca puts it on \u201cLast of the Spiddyocks,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s simple: Swing be the freakin\u2019 of the time/The spinnin\u2019 by the kings good for speakin\u2019 of the mind.\u201d Its smoothness feeds the agency of its inhabitants, whose vivid, weirdo raps conceptualize life outside of the binary.", "There\u2019s some talk of confrontational inner city street politics, but Digable were foremost promoters of peace and unity, and both their rap names and their music bore out their messages. ", " found a through-line from more philosophical thinking to pragmatic street-dweller wisdom and logic. References from big thinkers like Marx, Fromm, Sartre, Camus, and Nietzsche are scattered across the record, on songs like \u201cPacifics (Sdtrk \u2018N.Y. is Red Hot\u2019).\u201d The album got its name from an essay by Argentinian writer and theorist Jorge Luis Borges. They, like Borges, theorized that time and space are conceptual, relating only to individuals. Outside of its obvious jazz homage, the title track was meant as a mark of their aspirations, as Butterfly put it, their efforts \u201ctrying to get to a new place.\u201d", " is at once vintage and futuristic, a vision for a new utopia influenced by the past, daring to imagine insulated black communities as separate from Earth\u2014unified, Afrocentric, and untarnished by subjugation. It\u2019s a world within a world, complete with its own language and monuments and dogma\u2014comparing New York to a museum, its graffiti as much high art as the work of Dadaist Salvador Dal\u00ed. Digable Planets make their own pre-internet information exchange, where traveling a few blocks could mean an introduction to a completely new milieu, where little ever gets lost in translation, where the inspiration for ideas occurs as spontaneously as a trumpet solo.", "Butterfly produced ", " alongside soundmen Shane Faber and Mike Mangini in basic, makeshift studios erected in their tiny Jersey apartments. They were each well equipped to help see the group\u2019s vision through. (They had done programming and engineering work for ", ", Sean Combs, ", ", and Leaders of the New School. Faber was the engineer for Tribe\u2019s ", ".) The album\u2019s soundbed is warm and swinging. Carefully selected samples are sewn together at the hem. One sample might split open to reveal another, as on \u201cWhat Cool Breezes Do.\u201d Or they\u2019ll all feed right into each other; the flutes, guitars, and bass that segue one into the next on \u201cNickel Bags\u201d are all separate elements from separate songs. The samples they couldn\u2019t afford, they recreated. Each track is unique, and yet every one is a puzzle piece completing the group\u2019s cosmic take on transference.", "As the album\u2019s primary architect, Butterfly is at its center, but songs are often driven by Ladybug Mecca, who is silvery in her delivery, slipping promptly in and out of moments like a preternatural guru. Doodlebug imparts his wisdom as digressions, kicking facts in a wingman capacity. As a unit, they never miss a beat, constantly attuned to each other\u2019s frequencies, moving in sync and sharing ideas. So much of the action is reliant on their ability to read each other and react accordingly, to big-up someone when the moment strikes or to cede the spotlight just in time. This awareness pays off on \u201cTime & Space (A New Refutation Of),\u201d where each verse latches into the next, every MC propelling the one that comes after. The other members even give Butterfly the chance to do a few solo cuts, somehow never sucking the wind out of the group\u2019s sail. \u201cLa Femme Fetal,\u201d an upright bass-led pro-choice parable, is written in the style of Butterfly\u2019s idol, Jalal Mansur Nuriddin of the Last Poets, with a loose, almost interpretive flow that ebbs and rises to suit the inflections of Nuriddin\u2019s cosmic storytelling. The ode, one of rap\u2019s earliest defenses of women\u2019s rights, serves as a cornerstone of the group\u2019s progressive sensibilities.", " is among hip-hop\u2019s greatest artifacts, the realization of the Native Tongues vision for perfect rap harmony. They personify the balance they promote. It\u2019s an album that questions the very fabric of our existence while celebrating its nuances. As Digable Planets refute the boundaries of their continuum, their imagined cosmology creates a jazzy, spatial anomaly full of sonic wonders and game theory. It is an enduring, inclusive work that helped usher in a wave of vibrant, oddball thinkers in rap, a funk dimension that envelops you and embraces all. In service of the collective, one of rap\u2019s mellowest crews shared a heartfelt ode to soul and jazz that sought to open the gateway into a more enlightened future."]},

But local acclaim left the Walias Band hungry, and in 1981, they plotted a U.S. tour to launch their courtship of discerning westerners.

McLemore"], "text": ["The posthumous ambient music of the mercurial genius featured on \u201cS-Town\u201d is a peek into the sounds of his quiet and fascinating life.", "Since its release on March 28, 2017, the podcast \u201cS-Town\u201d has been downloaded over 40-million times, a figure that suggests just how many people have heard about the John B. McLemore, the mercurial genius from Bibb County, Alabama. In 2012, shortly after McLemore first connected his computer to the internet, he contacted Brian Reed, a producer at the documentary radio show \u201cThis American Life\u201d to investigate what he believed to be an alleged and covered-up murder in his hometown. The real story, as Reed and \u201cS-Town\u201d point out, was McLemore\u2014a renowned antiquarian horologist (an old clock repairman), an architect of intricate hedge mazes, an amateur expert in climate science, and an eloquent autodidact. Reed detailed McLemore like a character ripped from the pages of a Southern Gothic novel but in the middle of reporting his story, John B. McLemore killed himself by ingesting his own tincture of potassium cyanide.", "From an extensive Reddit fan ", " to a mountain of essays dissecting the ", " and ", " merits of the show, \u201cS-Town\u201d has produced its own cottage industry of errata and commentary in the year since its release. And perhaps the most unusual finding from McLemore\u2019s life comes from the ambient musician and painter Tor Lundvall. Right around the time McLemore was in contact with Brian Reed, he was also emailing Lundvall to express admiration for his work and to ask him if he could upload a mix of Lundvall\u2019s work (including his own remixes and original compositions) to ", ".", "Lundvall consented, and he and McLemore began a two-month-long exchange of emails and letters. One of the exchanges included five ambient pieces McLemore composed\u2014using manipulated field recordings collected around his property along with synths, drums, and piano\u2014in 2003. Lundvall only learned of McLemore\u2019s death after \u201cS-Town\u201d\u2019s release when he revisited the Youtube mix and saw commenters eulogizing McLemore. Since that discovery and after listening to \u201cS-Town,\u201d Lundvall and Dais have decided to make McLemore\u2019s music public, and that collection, ", ", provides a fascinating new way to understand the life of the most interesting man in podcasting history.", "\u2019 five pieces come with an important set of listening instructions: McLemore wrote that it \u201crequires a nearly Isolated listening environment...It should be heard After Midnight, in the Late Fall of the year, and, not surprisingly, a Very Long Attention span is a Prerequisite.\u201d Comprised of field recordings and instrumentation, the songs range from 55 seconds to over 22 minutes. Each composition is dark, sprawling, intricate, but rough, and almost DIY. The album\u2019s first six minutes, on its opener \u201cClock Chimes in the Mist\u201d is this hypnotic collage of clock chimes and the interlocking of gears\u2014giving a listener a meaningful peak into the personal emotion behind McLemore\u2019s craft as a horologist. Taking the song\u2019s title almost literally, slowly a kind of sonic fog rolls over the sounds of the clock, creating this undeniably spooky feeling. But it all breaks, and a chintzy synth line, drum machine, mournful piano, and later rain sounds slither their way into the scene. The piece hangs together, but the sudden, almost random shift in the middle shows McLemore might\u2019ve been still learning how to sew together a song, and the seams in many of these pieces are still showing.", "McLemore did show real chops as a fledgling ambient musician. On the album\u2019s second track, his cover of Lundvall\u2019s 2001 song \u201cDark Spring,\u201d he creates an evocative backdrop with the sound of a thick rainfall and swirling noise that is soothing and just a little screwy\u2014like encountering a Irv Teibel new age field recording if it was passed through a funhouse mirror. The collection\u2019s best song, \u201cHis Darker Paintings,\u201d is both simple and inventive: It\u2019s just a manipulation of recordings of dried seedpods being shaken like a rain stick, mixed with insect chirps and other environmental sounds. And right towards the end, those noises disappear and a creaky door opens, the sound looped over and over again, till the album ends, with the image and noise of a door left ajar being the last thing we encounter. It\u2019s absolutely haunting.", "Yet, even as I listened to the album over and over again, discovering new bits and pieces of sound each time, I kept feeling like looking at these songs on a purely musical level might be missing the point. The final lines from McLemore\u2019s suicide note rang in my head each time I played ", ": \u201cSometimes I just spent hours playing my records...Sometimes I sat in the dark and listened to the creaking of the old house,\u201d he wrote. The album is the closest someone will get to hearing what McLemore heard on his farm\u2014its field recordings of crickets, dog barks, clock machinery, and all the rest. As Ryan Martin, the co-founder of Dais notes, the album is attempting to \u201ccapture the universe\u201d of McLemore\u2019s home, and listening to ", ", it\u2019s hard to say he does not succeed.", "In a way, ", " is as tricky to critique as \u201cS-Town\u201d: As a personal work that might never have been intended to be consumed by a public audience. If we take the music for what is\u2014without all its baggage\u2014it is the work of an incredibly skilled amateur who showed great potential. But it is impossible to look at the work in a vacuum. As another accessory to \u201cS-Town,\u201d it gives the podcast\u2019s giant audience a new way to understand McLemore. From that angle, like the show, it feels beautiful and painful all at once to listen to even one minute ", "."]},

In an earlier era, when \u201cserious\u201d listening automatically implied a focus on either jazz or Western classical, the state of vinyl technology constrained runtime to two short-ish compositions\u2014a poor substitute for a night at the opera or a bebop quintet playing in a smoke-filled lounge. The album was invented when this shortcoming was addressed by binding multiple discs together into a book-like form\u2014hence \u201calbum\u201d\u2014compiled around an organizing theme. Only later did microgroove technology allow these thematic sets to fit on one LP, or \u201clong-player.\u201d", "In the 1970s Fela took all that extra runtime and slurped it right up with what you might call macro-grooves. His seemingly endless songs pushed willfully against the limits of the vinyl format, forcing open enough room for the sprawling, polyrhythmic, polyamorous Afrobeat machine that was his band Afrika \u201970 to assemble itself bit by bit, just as it did onstage. Accordingly, Fela long-players usually comprised only two songs, or even one song split in two. The approach gives a unique shape to the body of work he left us upon his passing in 1997. If anything makes Fela\u2019s work \u201cdifficult,\u201d it\u2019s not the lack of entry points; it\u2019s the length and depth of the passages they lead to. On such passages, it\u2019s nice to have a guide, someone who\u2019s traveled the road and can point out guideposts within his prolific discography.", "For those lucky enough to see him perform during his lifetime, Fela himself was that guide. Each serpentine groove (even longer outside the studio, his ", " covering just four songs in its two and a half hours) was tamed by his ease in the roles of shaman, emcee, and raconteur as well as singer and bandleader: talking and joking with his audience, cussing the corrupt politicians and systems that were his constant nemesis.

The seven pieces she has collected here comprise neither an all-time \u201cessentials\u201d list nor represent any particular side of Fela. Instead they follow certain threads across all phases of his evolution to create a playlist that is personalized, highly listenable, and in places revelatory, even to longtime fans.", "Badu\u2019s choose-your-own-Fela adventure leans heavily on the discs from the classic Afrika \u201970 lineup that included Allen\u2019s frenetic, virtuoso drumwork\u2014particularly those that broadcast Fela\u2019s fondness for a ", " groove. (Most of the recordings are paired in their original A/B sides.) The rhythm guitar work that establishes the key of \u201cYellow Fever\u201d and \u201cNo Agreement\u201d is practically slick with chicken grease. But Badu also explores lesser-known avenues, following those threads right up into his mostly overlooked 1992 release ", ".", "This makes for winding, hypnotic listening, drawing out specific facets that would be lost in any other shuffle of the Fela deck. There is, for instance, a preponderance of great Fela solos on keys and squonky saxophone, side trips that are by turns noodly and whimsical or plonky and dissonant (see the extended ", " organ freakout that occurs roughly 11 minutes into \u201cArmy Arrangement Pt. 2\u201d). This is less because great solos are absent elsewhere in his work than because Badu\u2019s ear seems to have settled on tracks with particularly raw mixdowns, emphasizing the head-music dynamic of Fela\u2019s playing over the grooves more conventionally suited to the dancefloor.", "There are still plenty of the big brass arrangements and fast, shekere-anchored marches that have inspired DJs to seek out Fela\u2019s music again and again in the last few decades. But far more often Badu has honed in on a particular strain of Afrobeat rhythm which marries the endlessly repetitive with the off-kilter (\u201cNo Agreement,\u201d \u201cPansa Pansa\u201d) in way that can be compared to almost nothing else outside of the krautrock mind-jams of ", ". An overall loose and lo-fi feel pervades the selections, amplified by the inclusion of songs which were actually recorded live, whether abroad (\u201cV.I.P.\u201d) or in Fela\u2019s Lagos stronghold, the Kalakuta Republic (\u201cJohnny Just Drop\u201d)\u2014a quality which, amazingly, prevents the three-odd hours of music from ever dragging its feet or overwhelming.", "In fact, the juxtaposition of tracks tends to enliven even the familiar ones (\u201cYellow Fever\u201d b/w \u201cNa Poi \u201975\u201d is the only disc which repeats from the previous three box sets, but inevitably one or two selections will already be on the shelves of ardent Fela fans). The listener is more likely to note the way a Rhodes keyboard\u2019s overmodulated and fuzzy tone cracks through the mix with the force of an electric guitar, while elsewhere Fela drums on the keys in a way that recalls melodic percussion of ", "\u2019s prepared piano\u2014or how his sax plays in a register so fat and low over the worryingly fast beat of \u201cJ.J.D.\u201d that it could be easily be mistaken for a tuba.", "There is another, more cerebral, reason to love viewing Fela through Badu\u2019s mirror shades, and that is the way in which her mind\u2014as expressed in the box set\u2019s extensive liner notes\u2014reinvigorates and recontextualize his politics as powerfully as her ear does the music. An unavoidable paradox of Fela\u2019s appeal lies in the way his resolutely Afrocentric challenge to colonialism and political corruption\u2014which at times extended to risking beatings, imprisonment, and even death while standing toe-to-toe with Nigeria\u2019s military dictatorship\u2014was undercut by a trenchant chauvinism.

While there are places where her liner notes feel a bit like homework that has been reluctantly, if creatively, phoned in (\u201cMy brain is tired of writing\u2026 I think I have some sort of disorder. This is only the fourth one\u2026 and I feel like I am being punished. What kind of mind sits up and writes all day?

Letting Afrobeat historian Chris May provide the more encyclopedic context for each track, Badu explores her personal connection to Fela\u2019s themes in terms so stream-of-consciousness insightful they could almost be ", " lyrics: \u201cFor an African to escape the cruels of inferiority complexes due to Colonialism unharmed, is like sucking on a big, thick juicy mango without its nectar slowly dripping down your wrist.

The melody is carried by what might be an electric saxophone from a 1980s infomercial, its cheesy, cheap tone closer to a duck quack. But whereas previous PSS productions would have just ridden that sound around and around, now Jutson and Butler deftly fold in more elements. Clean-picked guitar lines enter against a fluttering arpeggio (and upon repeated playback, a voice humming along in harmony).

Their legend has only grown since with Ryan, vocalist John Bigley, guitarist Tom Price, and bassist Jim Tillman representing a crucial link between the untethered garage assault of Seattle\u2019s early rock scene (", ", ", ") and the commercial explosion that happened there in the early 1990s.", "In any case, the hype was and is warranted. The music compiled on this set is taken from the group\u2019s sole full-length\u20141988\u2019s ", "\u2014and a handful of EPs, singles, and compilation appearances. It is brash and serpentine, a quick burning conflagration fueled by the group\u2019s collective love of adversarial punk and post-punk (they named themselves after the title of a ", " bootleg), and a tendency toward self-sabotage. There isn\u2019t much growth to be found within the U-Men\u2019s discography. The band that recorded a viscous four-song EP for Pavitt\u2019s short-lived record label Bomb Shelter in 1984 sounds pretty much the same as one that hit the studio four years later for a 7\u201d released on Amphetamine Reptile. But then again, there doesn\u2019t need to be. Once the classic U-Men lineup was in place, the four hit on a perfect formula that allowed them to set things to a boil or a steady simmer as needed.", "Within U-Men\u2019s chosen framework, the band found plenty of variation and ways to rip at their own seams. Price, especially, proved to be the molten core of the band. The guitarist could sound just as sinister jangling through a slow dance number like \u201cGreen Trumpet\u201d or hitting the clean, tolling chords of \u201cA Three Year Old Could Do That\u201d as he did slashing through \u201cLast Lunch\u201d or adding a gushing discordance to \u201cWhistlin\u2019 Pete.\u201d The influence of players like Poison Ivy of ", " and Pere Ubu\u2019s Tom Herman is evident, but he bends their ideas to his will rather than simply aping them.", "What truly helped fuel the U-Men\u2019s infamy was the presence of its vocalist, Bigley. The band were often compared to the equally unhinged and blazing Birthday Party and much of that was due to his vocal performances. Like ", ", Bigley could slip into an almost soothing croon, but that was often just a splash of color added to his Pollock-like canvas. He preferred to howl, spit, stutter, and wail like a feral animal finally let loose from its cage. Even a song as comparatively straightforward as the stop-start noise-rock grind of \u201cDig It a Hole\u201d\u2014released on a 1987 single by Black Label, another Pavitt-helmed imprint run out of Seattle shop Fallout Records\u2014is given an even more confrontational edge via Bigley\u2019s growling vocal attack.", "For as large as their shadow looms among a generation of musicians in Seattle, there\u2019s not much in the U-Men\u2019s sound that feels too connected to the grunge aesthetic. Outside of the crunch and gush of Price\u2019s guitar, there was far too much swing in their rhythms that more metal-inspired groups like ", " and ", " would dare. What the U-Men and their contemporaries like Green River and Skin Yard did was offer a promise beyond the simple three-chord attack of punk.", "They also proved a somewhat cautionary tale about how to survive as independent musicians. Though the U-Men\u2019s live shows within Seattle were memorable\u2014like the infamous appearance at the Bumbershoot Arts Festival in 1985 where they set fire to a small moat in front of their stage using lighter fluid\u2014their few tours outside the Northwest were hampered by multiple canceled dates and a lot of drink and drugs. If you were going to make it as a band, you\u2019d better have your shit together even just a little bit more than these guys did.", "There\u2019s no denying, though, how foundational the U-Men were. Their music stands now as both a crucial piece in the roiling Seattle scene and as part of a noise-rock continuum that includes like-minded outfits such as ", " and ", ". Some of U-Men\u2019s members did carry on after the band split in 1989, with Price starting the more rockabilly/garage-influenced Gas Huffer and Tillman playing bass with psych rockers Love Battery. But their work in the U-Men, as this essential document bears out, was a spark that helped their hometown emerge into a landmark on the international music atlas."]},

He abandoned its material in later setlists and denied he\u2019d ever even been a Christian, citing it as just another example of the media\u2019s unfair insistence on labeling him at every turn. \u201cI mean, nobody cares what Billy Joel\u2019s religious views are,\u201d he spat at one interviewer, who could have responded by pointing out that ", " never wrote a song called \u201cProperty of Jesus.\u201d Regardless of his true beliefs, ", " offers living proof of Dylan\u2019s commitment at the time. Across these 102 tracks, he sounds as devoted to his work as ever, puncturing a style of music built to offer definitive answers with his own heavy brand of cosmic nihilism.", "The era came to a close with \u201cEvery Grain of Sand,\u201d the final track on ", " Allegedly written fully-formed at the piano in the summer of 1980, it remains one of his most powerful compositions: If the sole purpose of his religious search was to lead him here, then the journey was worth it.

She was so often limited to her striking physical presence and icy \u201cunapproachable mystique.\u201d As Warhol\u2019s Screen Test shows, Nico possessed that inexplicable magnetism, a wordless ennui. But she was also written off as untouchable and unknowable, which by all accounts she was. \u201cShe had no inner life.

Despite the fact that each song on the album feels extracted from Nico\u2019s soul, she did not write any of the lyrics.

Consider the lyrics to \u201cAfraid\u201d off Nico\u2019s 1970 record ", ": \u201cYou are beautiful and you are alone.\u201d Detachment, the ever-present quality of Nico\u2019s voice, only intensified the idea of her as just an image.", "Throughout her life, Nico actively encouraged the air of mystery that followed her. She claimed to have been born everywhere, from Berlin to Budapest (definitively, it was Cologne, 1938). She said her estranged father was either a soldier with Hitler\u2019s Wehrmacht armed forces or a Turkish Sufi (it was former, and he was killed by a commanding officer, after being shot by a French sniper). When the British bombardment of Cologne intensified, mother and daughter moved to a small town outside of Berlin. After dropping out of school around the age of 14, Christa P\u00e4ffgen was discovered by the German fashion designer Heinz Oestergaard and began a fruitful modeling career.

About a year later, while studying at New York\u2019s Actors Studio with Lee Strasberg, she had a brief affair with French actor Alain Delon, which resulted in a son, Ari. By the time Nico met Warhol in 1965, she was already a Superstar of her own creation.", "She was hardly a singer, nor did she aspire to be one. Her unwavering Germanic baritone was a result of the opera and wartime propaganda anthems she grew up with and the jazz and blues she witnessed as a young model in Paris. But Nico\u2019s voice only heightened the spectacle Warhol desired. \u201cThe group needed something beautiful to counteract the kind of screeching ugliness they were trying to sell,\u201d explained Paul Morrissey, a Factory filmmaker and one of ", "\u2019s first managers, \u201cand the combination of a really beautiful girl standing in front of all this decadence was what was needed.\u201d Warhol had recently been approached to help open a discotheque in Long Island and was looking for a house band.

Enter Nico, who would be the band\u2019s \u201cwindow-dressing.\u201d", "Conflict between the Velvets and Nico erupted immediately, largely because of Nico\u2019s desire to sing every song. At this point, there were no songs fit for Nico\u2019s low, unbroken rumble in the Velvets\u2019 repertoire, so Warhol commissioned a reluctant ", " to write a few ballads for his rising star. The resulting songs\u2014\u201dFemme Fatale,\u201d \u201cAll Tomorrow\u2019s Parties,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Mirror\u201d\u2014are deep psychological studies rooted in Reed\u2019s complicated relationship to Nico and the cultural spectacle swirling around them. While each of these songs seems directly drawn from Nico\u2019s psyche, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Mirror\u201d is Nico in a nutshell. As French philosopher Jean Baudrillard wrote in his 1979 book ", ", \u201c\u2019I\u2019ll be your mirror\u2019 does not signify \u2019I\u2019ll be your reflection\u2019 but \u2019I\u2019ll be your deception.\u2019\u201d", "Despite its historical accolades, their 1967 album ", " was considered a commercial and financial failure, and as a result, the band was not playing many shows. Nico began a solo residency at the St. Marks street club The Dom where she was initially accompanied by a tape deck playing Reed\u2019s pre-recorded guitar solos. Apparently, it was painfully awkward, and soon Nico was joined by the actual Reed, ", ", Sterling Morrison, ", ", and a young ", ", who later became her lover. In the final weeks of Nico\u2019s residency, the Velvets presented her with an opportunity to join them on tour. Nico chose to stay in New York, symbolically ending her time with the Velvet Underground. \u201cI have a habit of leaving places at the wrong time, just when something big might have happened for me,\u201d she would say.", "But something big ", " happening for Nico.

Rather, these were the unreleased songs she had acquired through her residency at The Dom. Like her songs on ", ", each track is a remarkable communion between writer and singer. \u201cI am the person, the Chelsea Girl,\u201d Nico declared while revisiting the hotel years later. The record takes its name from Warhol\u2019s split-screen 1966 experimental film ", ", which documents the mundane activities of scenesters at the legendary Chelsea Hotel. \u201cChelsea Girl\u201d is a continuation of the film in the form of a ballad about the hotel\u2019s S&M queens, Superstars, and junkies; every character\u2019s verse contains a heartbreaking epitaph like, \u201cHer future died/In someone\u2019s past.\u201d", " presents a young woman torn between the regrets of her past and the unknown but hopeful future.

But upon listening to Browne\u2019s twangy version of \u201cThese Days,\u201d it becomes obvious that Nico\u2019s droning, Germanic drawl is what makes the song so affecting.", "While Browne focuses on transitions, Cale pushes Nico into more a more esoteric realm. On \u201cLittle Sister\u201d (co-written with Reed), Nico\u2019s voice is flat and brooding in direct contrast to the whimsical organ which pipes along beside her. She sings in \u201cperfect mellow ovals\u201d as Goldstein wrote in 1966. \u201cIt sounds something like a cello getting up in the morning.\u201d \u201cWinter Song\u201d on the other hand, basks in an almost medieval atmosphere which is heightened lyrically by talk of  \u201ctyranny,\u201d \u201croyal decay,\u201d and the \u201cworshipping wicked.\u201d The closest thing to a Velvet Underground song on ", " is Reed, Nico, and Cale\u2019s hefty eight-minute \u201cIt Was a Pleasure Then.\u201d While Cale\u2019s viola groans with distortion and Reed\u2019s guitar drives into darkness, Nico\u2019s voice soars into a wordless soprano at the peak of her range.

She dyed her blonde hair with henna and trading her white clothing for an all-black ensemble. \u201cI felt that at last I was independent, and that I knew what independence was,\u201d she said.", "But while Nico was taking some control of her music, her life was spiraling. There was the time in 1974 that she performed the German national anthem \u201cDas Lied der Deutschen\u201d including the verses that were banned in 1945 due to their Nazi associations. A year later, Nico was dropped from Island because she told a reporter that she \u201cdidn\u2019t like negroes.\u201d In an alleged instance in the early \u201970s, Nico declared that she \u201chate[d] black people,\u201d smashed a wine glass on a table, and stabbed the eye of a mixed-race singer who worked with Jimi Hendrix.

It did this by unabashedly culling references from 1980s pop culture, repurposing the pulpy horror tropes of the era into a story that resonated with a contemporary audience. There\u2019s nothing wrong with \u201cstyle over substance\u201d as a guiding aesthetic for a series like this; when done well, that sense of surface-level nostalgia can help create a world that feels both familiar and intriguing.

Their first collaborations, \u201cOde\u201d and \u201c", ",\u201d appear here as B-sides. On \u201cOde,\u201d the most narrative moment on the EP, Dunphe and McDonnell\u2019s voices intertwine in an elegy for female isolation under late capitalism.

Conversely, in \u201c2Tru,\u201d written by Popovic (also of Trans FX), Dunphe\u2019s hushed fragments are carried away on waves of thick shoegaze, becoming another instrument in a mix of droning guitar and textured helicopter synths.

Dunphe\u2019s vocals gulp air, sometimes breathy, sometimes breathless. \u201cThe choice was made for me/Now I don\u2019t know when I should leave,\u201d she sings, drawing out the last note, letting it dip grotesquely, until it catches in her throat like the choice itself. As Dunphe hashes out the moral value of transience versus permanence (\u201cIs it right to stay? Is home a trap and growth a phase?\u201d), McDonnell strings together melody after melody on airy, jangling guitar and warm, nostalgic synths straight out of a John Hughes soundtrack. It\u2019s a track that begs for a hazy party scene, the main character moving slowly through a crowded house or dark club, fashion goths swaying to the steady padded breakbeats, lights fading in and out with the synths\u2014bright but always a little sad.", "McDonnell is elusive when it comes to press; Dunphe, even more so. With that, the circumstances around the ", " EP remain undefined. But with all its thematic mourning and yearning for truth, it feels born out of a moment of change.

The photo is not exclusively focused on Ware and the shadows pooling around her; the eye is drawn as much to the soft, ruddy brown of the walls or the blue sky packed into a crisp rectangle above her. Ware wanted the cover to emphasize architecture; as she explained ", " the week before the image was shot, \u201cI want it to be a beautiful image that maybe I\u2019m a small part of.\u201d", "Each song on ", " has its own distinct aesthetic; unlike her previous albums, 2012\u2019s ", " and 2014\u2019s ", ", there are no songs here that could be confused for each other, none that seem an afterthought carved from the greater mood of the album.

It almost feels like Ware is trying to divert attention from herself, but she is positioned directly at the center of the album\u2019s trembling choreography. She connects each of these unrelated environments\u2014shaping them, in the tradition of singers like Anita Baker, into slippery vacuums of desire. They\u2019re songs about how feelings tend not to map onto reality, and how reality tends to be undisturbed by the weight of our feelings. And ", " came at a deepy emotional time for Ware; she wrote much of its lyrics after giving birth to her daughter, while immersed in the exhaustion of early parenthood.", "The intimacy that exists at the margins of sleep isn\u2019t ordinarily a subject of pop music; in the last 10 years, it can be mostly located in R&B songs like ", "\u2019s \u201cNo Sleeep,\u201d ", "\u2019s \u201cPretty Wings,\u201d and ", "\u2019s \u201c", ",\u201d among others.

Dave and Palladino are extraordinary, dexterous players; on Ware\u2019s songs, which aren\u2019t necessarily detached from either funk or soul, they express themselves primarily through restraint\u2014Dave barely plays on the verses of \u201cSelfish Love,\u201d and his interlocking rhythms in the chorus make it sound as if the track is being pushed by whispers. Stint supplies live drums to the slow jam \u201cStay Awake, Wait for Me,\u201d and the delay between each snare hit adds a stretchy emptiness between Ware\u2019s shivering musical sighs.

Given the way he built himself up in his first decade of public life, he was bound to fall sooner or later: Danzig presented himself as a smooth-voiced demon, a guy with a library of occult tomes and an endless supply of primal lust\u2014the very stuff of Parental Advisory label hysteria and banned MTV videos. His music was tight and muscular, and he made sure he and his band appeared that way, too, particularly after he moved from New Jersey to L.A. But this macho posturing had its limits. In time, many fans went from exalting \u201cTired of Being Alive,\u201d the down-and-out rallying cry from 1990\u2019s ", ", to actually being tired of his ", " and questionable art direction. No metal god is truly immortal, infallible, or devoid of humanity, so perhaps we shouldn\u2019t have been surprised to find by the mid-\u201990s that Danzig, at his core, is the sort of guy who gets bummed that ", ". Before all that, though, there was one album that lived up to the mighty image he\u2019d built: 1992\u2019s ", ", where the classic lineup of his solo band in its prime found an emotional maturity unmatched by any record he made before or after. It\u2019s Danzig at his most sinister, yet also his most human.", "Danzig\u2019s voice has always carried a hint of tenderness, and in ", "\u2019s slower tracks, that quality comes to the fore. The title track poses a heavy question in a soft tone: \u201cIf you feel alive/If you\u2019ve got no fear/Do you know the name/Of the one you seek?\u201d The implication is clear: Are you ready for power you may not be able to comprehend? Are you ready to go to the next level? He and his bandmates surely were. Throughout the album, Danzig, guitarist John Christ, bassist Eerie Von, and drummer Chuck Biscuits achieve a bigger, denser sound than they\u2019d previously had. Danzig\u2019s subtle croon only intensifies the effect of the blaze\u2014stoked by desperate longing, he sounds that much more demonic. The nickname \u201cEvil Elvis\u201d had been lobbed at him ever since his 1988 solo debut, largely due to the way he packaged ferocious energy in accessible charm and his deep, roaring vocal delivery. But ", " is a more important spiritual influence on Danzig\u2019s style, at least on this album, even if \u201cEvil Roy\u201d doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Orbison was goth before goth, draping himself with darkness not just in his black-on-black look, but in his lovelorn voice and his tales of sorrow. You can hear his music echoed clearly in \u201cSistinas,\u201d a sincerely romantic love song where vibrato guitar and delicate strings back Danzig\u2019s somber words (\u201cI lost my soul, deep inside/Oh, and it\u2019s so black and cold\u201d). Orbison\u2019s shadow is there, too, on \u201cAnything,\u201d a sweet ballad that ripens into a rager. On ", ", Danzig isn\u2019t the shape-shifting, demonic wolfman of his earlier records. He\u2019s a devil who ", ", thinking about the one that got away while he sits on a throne of skulls.", "Elsewhere, the bluesier tracks get even more juiced up than usual, largely a result of Danzig taking on an increased production role alongside ", ". The slyly seductive 1988 track \u201cMother,\u201d which would become a hit after being remixed a year after this album\u2019s release, remains Danzig\u2019s calling card, but \u201cDirty Black Summer\u201d is the song that perfects the form. Despite its name, it\u2019s an elevated dirtbag rocker for all seasons, with Christ channeling every beer-soaked \u201970s guitar hero into one of his most jubilant riffs; \u201cSummer\u201d swings faster, burns harder, and revs up to a hallucinatory peak.", "Christ\u2019s guitar playing was easily the most irreplaceable aspect of this era of the band. On ", ", he was in sync with the early 1990s\u2019 disdain for flash, yet far closer to a raw blues tradition than, say, the industrial crunch of White Zombie\u2019s Jay Yuenger or Prong\u2019s Tommy Victor (who would go on to play with Danzig starting in 1996 and join the band permanently in 2008). A lot of his style at the time had to do with Danzig\u2018s interest in pre-rock blues and pop music\u2014Christ ", " that his personal taste is more driven by classical and jazz\u2014but he\u2019s still a crucial reason why Danzig\u2019s first four albums, especially ", ", are revered today. Lately, even Danzig himself seems to have come around to appreciating Christ\u2019s contributions to his sound: His two most recent albums, 2015\u2019s ", " and this year\u2019s ", ", both sounded as though Victor was aiming to recreate Christ\u2019s looser approach (with some success, particularly on ", "). All of this only makes it more obvious how important Christ was circa ", ". He shouldn\u2019t have to settle for ", "\u2014and it\u2019s worth noting that he ", " to playing with Danzig again.", " marks the moment when Danzig transcended his punk origins and staked out a deeper place in the modern music canon, patching together the influences of Dixon, Orbison, and Howlin\u2019 Wolf into something grand. It\u2019s a record about confronting your inner strength, testing if it\u2019s enough to endure heartbreak and uncontrollable lust; it\u2019s about feeling that God is failing you, and wanting the power of a god all the same. Danzig himself would never again be able to seek higher truth in his music quite like this without devolving into trite spirituality. By 1995, the classic lineup of his band had collapsed. Various hardcore sidekicks came and went in Danzig\u2019s ranks in the years that followed, and while that kept him on the road, the gleam in his eye circa ", " was often missing. A quarter-century after this watershed album, he\u2019s still at it, even if recreating the howls of \u201cBodies\u201d and \u201cDirty Black Summer\u201d is more labor-intensive these days.

The two projects sounded pretty similar, actually: Both took 1990s deep house and suffused it in tape hiss and sly sample flips.

His debut LP pushes even further in this direction.", "The hallmarks of his sound have not changed since his early uploads. In fact, a number songs here have been floating around YouTube for a year or more. His drums, whether breakbeats or samples from classic machines like the 808, are pushed into the red until they ooze distortion; his kick drums practically leave bloody marks where they land. At the same time, his programming yields nimble hi-hat patterns and lots of skipping syncopation. It\u2019s a neat contrast: heavy, swollen sounds made magically weightless.", "His synths and samples have a similarly vintage, battered air. The bassline of \u201cToo Late for U and M1\u201d is a winking throwback to the Korg M1 organ sound made famous by scads of early-\u201990s pop-dance hits like Robin S.\u2019 \u201c", ".\u201d The TB-303\u2019s undulating acid squiggles worm their way across the album.

What makes DJ Seinfeld\u2019s music worthwhile is its genuinely affecting emotional tenor. He\u2019s got a knack for sumptuous chord changes that can make even suspicious listeners feel some type of way: Just check the bittersweet keys of \u201cU,\u201d with their air of Bruce Hornsby heard through the world\u2019s saddest, drunkest jukebox, or the winsome interplay between bassline, synths, and ribbony vocals on \u201cI Saw Her Kiss Him in Front of Me and I Was Like WTF?\u201d (Much like his alias, DJ Seinfeld\u2019s titles often feel almost like brazenly self-aware performance art.)", "At times, his knack for taking four bars of misty-eyed pop and throwing a suggestive veil over it recalls ", "\u2019s ", ". And on \u201cU Hold Me Without Touch,\u201d the way he takes long strips of sampled vocals and inserts them into his own productions\u2014as the singing bobs teasingly in and out of key\u2014recalls another nostalgia-prone musician who likes to frontload his tunes with the surface noise of well-worn wax: ", ". He recalls Burial thematically, too. Just as Burial\u2019s music evokes a lost rave utopia the UK producer was too young to have experienced firsthand, Jakobsson ", " that his perspective on the \u201990s amounts to \u201cthis kind of fake type of nostalgia. It was around me, but I wasn\u2019t a part of it.\u201d", "Sincerity, rather than authenticity, is the watchword. Jakobsson readily acknowledges that he makes all of his music on the computer; the amp distortion and tape compression are just illusory effects dialed up in his software production suite. (Once upon a time, \u201c", "\u201d was the operative question; these days, it\u2019s \u201cIs it Memorex, or is it Ableton?\u201d) Perhaps it\u2019s because he leans upon these effects so heavily, but there\u2019s something disconcerting about a style so dependent upon these kinds of simulacra; it\u2019s unclear how much is the talent, and how much is the tools. Across the span of the album, the ubiquitous sonic degradation can get old; one wishes there were a little more variety in the record\u2019s sound design.", "Nevertheless, on the best tracks, like \u201cU\u201d and \u201cU Hold Me Without Touch,\u201d Jakobsson\u2019s chosen effect suits the mood. There\u2019s something cathartic about hearing such sentimental melodies turned up so loud, to the point of distortion. It gives the sense that there\u2019s more emotion here than the tape\u2014or the hard drive, anyway\u2014can contain. Anyone who\u2019s spent a lovelorn night blasting sad songs through their home stereo can identify with the desire to wallow in an excess of sentiment.

He was taken with its pristine architecture, with its view of the trees in its courtyard from the interior. Yoshimura imagined his nascent work in relationship to that space, and inquired about having the finished piece played there; the museum agreed. The titular nine postcards, nodding back to that view from the Hara Museum, refer to a series of window views.

Composed with a minimal setup including a Fender Rhodes piano, the songs collected here are built around simple melodies that Yoshimura modulates in small, affecting ways.

In a sense, though these sounds are conversational in their way, Yoshimura leaves quite a bit of room for the listener\u2019s mood and memories. The record\u2019s effects are, like the nature iconography he invokes, delivered with broad, almost neutral strokes. But space\u2014even, or especially, the crowded and overwhelming urban kind\u2014is necessarily emotional. It is loaded with memory, or whatever abstract something floats in the air when humans have been feeling their way through a place\u2014and he taps into this characteristic of our every-day beautifully. Yoshimura\u2019s practice shines light onto corners of feeling that might otherwise go unnoticed.", "Yoshimura and Ashikawa\u2019s ideas about sound and space remain relevant, especially as public space becomes ever-more fraught with anxiety and the infrastructural and social fractures that result from austerity. The mediations proposed on this album are intimate in scale but effective and timeless, unadorned such that they maintain a universality. Yoshimura\u2019s output extends far beyond what\u2019s captured on this release, and a resurgence of interest\u2014and the promise of further reissues\u2014hopefully means more documentation around his work will be available in English.

The depth-charge doom of Portland duo the Body supplied the foundation, with drums that rattled like cannon fire and guitars that groaned as if from an abyss. The menacing grindcore of Maryland quartet Full of Hell shot and scattered across that frame, with blast beats arriving unannounced and high-treble riffs jutting from the din. The pitched squeals of the Body\u2019s Chip King and the feverish vitriol of Full of Hell\u2019s Dylan Walker made for excellent foils, just as both bands\u2019 embrace of electronics allowed one to warp the other.

King\u2019s screams and Walker\u2019s growls crisscross frantically, a duet for broken angels. Lined with feedback and caked in static, closer \u201cI Did Not Want to Love You So\u201d is an uncommon exercise in restraint, both bands locked into a dirge that terrorizes only through suggestion.

Yes, ", " is destructive music, streaked with shrieked lyrics about prey and death, age and tears. But it\u2019s also an inspiring, instructive record, too, where two brutal bands find solidarity and something to celebrate in the darkness.

The old-fashioned rock band\u2019s success seems almost unaccountably spectacular: sold-out nationwide stadium tours; two albums diamond-certified and a dozen more platinum; 16-time recipients of the Juno, the Canadian Grammy. And yet their success has remained confined to the homeland. In 1992, the Hip\u2019s fourth album, ", ", was the number-one record in Canada, and ", " insisted the band was \u201cnow poised for international recognition.\u201d It never happened. Abroad, the album flopped. By the late 1990s they no longer even had an American label. Last August, the Hip filled the nearly 20,000-capacity Air Canada Centre in Toronto three nights in succession; a scalped ticket cost thousands. When they performed in New York the year before, it was at the 2894-seat Beacon Theater. Many attendees, one presumes, were ex-pats from the north.", "So when Gord Downie\u2014lead singer, lyricist, and charismatic frontman of the Hip, but also poet, activist, actor, accomplished solo singer-songwriter, and altogether one of the most illustrious men in Canadian pop-cultural history\u2014died last month of glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive and virtually unbeatable form of brain cancer, Americans were understandably mystified by the extent and depth of their northern neighbors\u2019 grief. It is hard to convey to outsiders what Downie meant to his compatriots. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, upon learning of Downie\u2019s passing, was compelled to issue a statement of mourning to the nation. \u201cWhen he spoke,\u201d Trudeau said, \u201che gave us goosebumps and made us proud to be Canadian.

The album was recorded over two wildly productive four-day sessions at Downie\u2019s Bathouse studio in small-town Bath, Ontario, as Downie endured the often brutal effects of his illness and its treatment\u2014memory loss, frailty. The process was a minor miracle of last-ditch vigor: 23 songs in all, many laid down in one take. \u201cWe were documenting how he was feeling, very quickly,\u201d said Broken Social Scene\u2019s Kevin Drew, who produced the album. \u201cThere was an urgency that pushed us to create as much as we could.\u201d", "That urgency looms over ", ", even seems at times to haunt it. \u201cIn my life of get and get/I\u2019ve got more than most, and yet,\u201d Downie sings on \u201cWolf\u2019s Home,\u201d movingly. His reflections of regret are painful enough, but in the song\u2019s final seconds one hears him sigh, almost beyond the range of the mic, and take a greedy draft of water. It\u2019s a moment of profoundly wretched candor\u2014a glimpse of weariness committed by mistake to tape. On the delicate, piano-forward title track, Downie relates the story of forgetting the name of a driver he could tell he ought to recall: a mild lapse, probably familiar to almost anyone. But knowing what one does of his condition, of the misery of his failing memory, the story gains a tragic dimension. Much of the power of ", " derives expressly from woeful circumstance, perhaps inevitably. Listening, one is acutely aware of how much Downie still had to say\u2014and how little time he had left.", "But it would be a mistake to characterize ", " as despairing. Downie was an unrepentant optimist, and remained playful even at his most wistful and pensive. On stage, in concert, he played the howling maniac, the madman unhinged: He would rant and rave, improvise lyrics, toss his microphone around and pick it up with his feet\u2014and continued to do so as his illness did its best to enfeeble him. That puckish exuberance is very much in evidence throughout ", ", happily. \u201cYou Me and the B\u2019s\u201d is a spirited paeon to \u201cthe mistakes, the slumps, the streaks\u201d of the Boston Bruins, replete with percussion by hockey stick (really). \u201cMy First Girlfriend\u201d is an ode to an old flame\u2014in particular to her \u201csophistication\u201d and her bikini. And of course, the upbeat \u201cSpoon\u201d is about seeing Britt Daniel and company live: \u201cWe sat in the back row/Deerhunter opened the show.\u201d", "The record\u2019s prevailing theme, if it isn\u2019t apparent already, is reminiscence. Downie has said that \u201ceach song is about a person,\u201d and while he scarcely uses proper names, the abundant \u201cyou\u201ds and \u201cwe\u201ds feel unmistakably specific. \u201cI say \u2018I love you\u2019 into your dark, unwavering eyes/That show caring, concern, disapproval, despair,\u201d he sings with evident strain on \u201cFaith Faith,\u201d the album\u2019s most overtly sentimental ballad. \u201cBut you\u2019ll never leave me, never doubt me, never look elsewhere.\u201d Downie\u2019s lyrics generally have an ironic edge; in this case, as he was separated from his wife, it\u2019s safe to assume one isn\u2019t meant to take the romantic fervor in earnest. Mostly, though, the recollections are fond. \u201cBedtime\u201d immortalizes a precious memory of rocking his baby to sleep. \u201cLove Over Money,\u201d a distinctly Kevin Drew-ish indie-rock jam, glories in Downie\u2019s triumphs with his band.", "From beginning to end, ", " is ardently, defiantly hopeful, even as Downie\u2019s fate casts the record in a more melancholic light. True to his career-long reputation, he proves a paragon of warmth and generosity, democratic in spirit and comradely in temper. Downie spent his last year and a half not resigned to defeat but buoyant with enthusiasm. Tellingly, while his nationwide farewell tour last summer took an enormous toll on him physically, watching him perform, you would have had no idea he was ill. The man was irrepressible. His defiance and ebullience were the fuel that urged him on until the very end.", "To hear Downie tell it, he never cared that the Hip failed to find success in the United States. He was irritated to be so frequently defined by that lack. \u201c[Interviewers] always ask us about our success or lack of success in the States, which I find absurd,\u201d he said in 1997, plainly vexed. \u201cAll we\u2019ve ever wanted to do was be successful on our own terms, which is to have a body of work become undeniable, to be known for 50 songs rather than one.\u201d In Canada, if not elsewhere, the oeuvre endures; to the entire country it seems the Hip are eternal. But if Downie\u2019s music should remain largely obscure, that would be most unfortunate\u2014not because he merits fame, but because he so keenly fought to forge connections.

Miller, for his part, reins in the guitars in favor of reverbed bass, synthesized vocal syllables, and incongruously cheery disco keys, playing up the song\u2019s internal contradictions. Sleigh Bells rode for a while on the contrast between Miller\u2019s hardcore-trained guitar playing and Krauss\u2019s clean soprano, but by this point they have to dig up more subtle incongruities, scraping together sounds that don\u2019t quite fit and leveraging them toward a broader sense of disquiet.", "The song that lingers the longest off ", ", though, is also its most internally cohesive. \u201cAnd Saints\u201d punctuates the record with a more or less straight narrative: Everyone is worried about Krauss; even the delivery guy who comes to her door wants to know if she\u2019s OK.

The frenetic pulses and tantrums that made Sleigh Bells songs instantly recognizable ebb away, leaving a surprising tenderness in their wake. When they push aside their usual bag of tricks, Krauss and Miller have it in them to write direct and disarming pop songs, the kind that reach out to comfort you in your helplessness.

The album also marked a changing of the guard, with Coltrane welcoming into the spotlight a scrappy, untested generation of iconoclastic players, many of whom were beginning to embrace emergent strains of black-power philosophy in their music.

Where Coltrane kicked off his album with a quick 30 seconds of fanfare before diving in, Sanders lets Burrell and Sharrock lead with almost five minutes of roiling piano and guitar, backed by bells, thrumming bass, and cinematic tom rolls. It doesn\u2019t take much to imagine a sacred rite of initiation performed in a darkened room filled with the scent of frankincense. This gives way to a bowed bass-and-piccolo duet between Grimes and Sanders that owes more to Toru Takemitsu\u2019s fusion of European modernism and traditional Japanese music than New York\u2019s jazz nightclubs. Nine minutes in, Grimes finally settles into a groove and the group falls into place, vamping on two breezy chords.

Yet despite the lingering dweebiness of Thomas\u2019 performance, the piece soars. By allowing soulful prettiness alongside more vicious passages, Sanders opens the album up, connecting the dots between joyful communion and unflinching catharsis. A squalling solo toward the end of the side sounds like a cry from the deepest, most tortured part of his soul, but it\u2019s supported by an unerringly mellow piano accompaniment (and answered by still more yodeling, now comfortably chilled out in the back of the mix).

The album is split into two side-long sessions, and the group, now an octet, breathes as one like never before.

If the title track finds the players in a joyous, near-telepathic groove, \u201cLet Us Go Into the House of the Lord\u201d is simply spiritual jazz of the highest order. Aching with emotion, it stands alongside Alice Coltrane\u2019s \u201c", "\u201d and Albert Ayler\u2019s \u201c", "\u201d as a devotional masterpiece and a fulfillment of free jazz\u2019s promise.

The song\u2019s title couldn\u2019t be more apt; the music exudes so much sorrow, hope, compassion, joy, and humanity it seems to truly reach for a home beyond our world.", "The decades that followed saw Sanders\u2019 career take different turns, never quite reaching the ecstatic highs of this era, and much of his early work fell out of print. What\u2019s remarkable about these reissues is not only how timeless the music is, but how relevant it feels today. Many of his contemporaries seemed to be pushing forward to see how far out they could go and who could get there fastest. Sanders went straight for the source. By pursuing a spiritual approach, he created a body of work that responded to its own historical moment without being time-stamped by it. Shortly after Coltrane and his group recorded ", ", LA was engulfed in the flames of the Watts riots; by the time ", " was released, Martin Luther King, Jr., had been murdered.

The phrase \u201cautomatic for the people\u201d is the satisfaction-guaranteed slogan posted at a popular diner in the band\u2019s native Athens; it also speaks to the pressures of a band that had just sold 10 million albums and needed to serve up more hits.

Even as Stipe\u2019s celebrity skyrocketed in the wake of \u201cLosing My Religion\u201d getting played nonstop on MTV, R.E.M. remained an intensely democratic unit, a quality that\u2019s emphasized in the outtakes on this 25th-anniversary reissue. Many of them reveal that Stipe\u2019s melodies and lyrics were often the final pieces of the puzzle to be set into place, as he hems and hums his way through otherwise structurally sound versions of \u201cFind the River\u201d (once known as \u201c10K Minimal\u201d) and \u201cIgnoreland\u201d (n\u00e9e \u201cHowler Monkey\u201d).

And in lieu of his normally deadpan speaking voice, you can hear an audible excitement over the prospect that America was on the brink of a major paradigm shift. Alas, that cautious optimism has curdled once again into despair a quarter-century later, when presidential elections are still being fought and won on coal-industry pandering and climate-change denial.

{"artists": ["Angel Olsen"], "album": ["Phases"], "text": ["This collection of B-sides, demos, and covers is terrific and revelatory in its own right. It's a trail of dropped clues to the creative process of the defiantly mercurial Olsen.", "A couple of years ago, Angel Olsen performed a show inside a church revival-style tent in Luck, Texas. I\u2019ll wager that most of us camped out on those wooden benches had never actually been to an actual revival, and the situation in which we found ourselves, below the low, pointed roof of a round canvas tarp out of which a succession of bands played on a tiny wooden platform, was more akin to a production design rendering of what a revival might look like. In fact, we were on a film set. Olsen\u2019s concert was part of the daylong Heartbreaker Banquet at Willie Nelson\u2019s Red-Headed Stranger ranch, the setting for his 1986 film of the same name. Outside the tent, there was a fake jailhouse, a fake opera house, people streaming by with South by Southwest wristbands and plastic cups of keg beer. Inside, as dusk fell and darkness filled the tent, Olsen went on, delivering a spare and haunting performance in tune with the murky glow of the lanterns.", "It was a year between two pivotal albums for Olsen\u2014the stunning and scarred folk songs of ", ", and 2016\u2019s ", ", writ much larger in every sense\u2014still contemplative, but escalating in power. She seemed to summon Stevie Nicks in arena-ready songs like \u201cSister,\u201d she skated backwards in a tinsel wig in the video she directed for \u201cShut Up Kiss Me.\u201d Though she\u2019s  graduated to bigger stages, backed by a full band, cracking jokes between songs, it occurred to me there in the tent that this wasn\u2019t just a singer downsizing to a smaller venue, but that Olsen was using the setting in a hyper-explorative way, approaching the idea of a song as a transfiguring, mutable thing. It\u2019s in that spirit that her new album, ", ", which collects a dozen of Olsen\u2019s demos, B-sides, and cover songs recorded over the past five years, arrives now.", "\u201c[I]t\u2019s like a diary was stolen and mass produced,\u201d Olsen wrote in a recent ", ", \u201cbut that\u2019s chill with me, I got nothing to hide.\u201d She was being, of course, a little bit coy.

Sequencing tracks out of the chronology of their recording, the album nevertheless forms its own arc\u2014a trajectory between daring and solace, a protagonist learning what it means to risk love. Songs like the demo \u201cSans,\u201d which yearns for a solution \u201cas easy as just picking up the phone,\u201d and \u201cSpecial,\u201d recall Exile in Guyville-era Liz Phair in their spare, strumming core\u2014they draw fuel from their admission of longing. \u201cOnly with You\u201d is a cry-yourself-to-sleep lullaby and lament (\u201cYou can love you can love you can lose/ Even at your own game\u201d), but the song that follows \u201cIt\u2019s All Right,\u201d also from the Burn Your Fire for No Witness sessions in 2013 is a beautiful bolstering, as if the same person woke up and delivered herself a self-affirmation.", "I\u2019m partial to the dirty guitars, desert echo, and pounding drums of \u201cSweet Dreams,\u201d the way Olsen turns the word alone into an incantatory Roy Orbison wail.

There\u2019s nothing so risky and naked as revealing your heart\u2019s desire, as she does in \u201cCalifornia,\u201d where the album crescendos. When she sings, \u201cI\u2019ve never felt quite so open for love/ I\u2019ve never felt quite so open before,\u201d her voice gapes wide, hitting a high soprano vibrato so tremulous it feels like she\u2019s on the verge of tears. But that\u2019s just Olsen fooling again\u2014right when she reaches a kind of emotional and vocal free-fall, she snaps it all back, reminding you she was in control the entire time.

Olsen does heartfelt justice to Roky Erickson\u2019s \u201cFor You,\u201d one of the most rarest and most beautiful of his solo songs; a forthright declaration of love in a jaunty Orbison-esque rhythm. Olsen\u2019s home-recorded rendition, with a guitar and chorus, is warm and unadorned\u2014there\u2019s little you need to add to a line as indelible as \u201cI\u2019m cooked to you so rare.\u201d", "I\u2019d always figured \u201cEndless Road,\u201d which Olsen regularly includes in her set lists, to be a Johnny Cash ballad I\u2019d somehow never heard.

Olsen first heard it while watching rerun TV with her mother; later she learned that Axton\u2019s mother wrote the song. In any case, Olsen plaintively identifies with the curse and blessing of being the restless seeker, refusing to be pinned down, but also acknowledging its costs. Her voice soars far past the even timbre of Axton\u2019s delivery, reaching treacherous heights at its apex: \u201cTill I can lay this lonesome body down.\u201d It\u2019s her traveling song, and the perfect closer to an album that pulls together winding, thrilling paths, united here in their searching."]},

So the fact that this box set exists at all is a minor miracle. What\u2019s even more remarkable is the fact that, while listening to these seven discs attentively in one sitting would require you to book a day off from your job, it rarely feels like work. Even after their fleeting late-\u201980s moment as a Top 40 threat had passed, and the quality of their albums became more of a crap shoot, the Fall remained an intriguingly unpredictable singles band, one whose cantankerous, chaotic reputation belies their economical songcraft and stylistic malleability.", " emulates the segregated format of Beggars Banquet\u2019s popular 1990 compilations ", " and ", ". The box set\u2019s first three discs (which are also available as a separate package) chronologically chart the journey from debut single \u201cBingo-Master\u2019s Break Out\u201d to last year\u2019s \u201cWise Ol\u2019 Man,\u201d with each disc loosely representing a distinct phase in their evolution: the minimalist garage-punk origins, the semi-pop era, and the post-millennial free-for-all.

Separating the A-sides from B-sides makes a certain amount of sense, providing both an easy entry point into the band\u2019s labyrinthine catalog and a scenic path for more committed listeners to go down. At the same time, with a band like the Fall, the distinction between A-sides and B-sides was often largely arbitrary\u2014a B-side banger like 1981\u2019s \u201cFantastic Life\u201d could be just as rousing as any lead single from the same era; an A-side rumbler like 1986\u2019s \u201cLiving Too Late\u201d could be just as cold and imposing as any oddity tucked on the flipside.", "From the get-go, the Fall were clearly unlike any other punk band. Sure, the surface sneer of gut-punching early singles like \u201cIt\u2019s the New Thing\u201d may have aligned Mark. E.

The Fall are often classified as post-punk\u2014a movement synonymous with anti-rock experimentation and futurist principles\u2014but in their early years, they were more interested in putting a post-modernist spin on pre-punk sounds. They cultivated mutant strains of country (\u201cFiery Jack\u201d), 1950s rockabilly (\u201cLie Dream of a Casino Soul,\u201d which sounds like \u201cTequila\u201d being subjected to electro-shock therapy), and 1960s garage (\u201cPsycho Mafia,\u201d a showcase for original keyboardist Una Baines\u2019 eerily emotionless, ice-picked organ lines). And even as Smith\u2019s lyrics turned increasingly cryptic, he still trafficked in relatable subjects\u2014football, World War II, over-caffeination\u2014that made him more at home with the factory workers at the local pub than the art-school students at the discotheque. But then, Smith had a peculiar gift for rendering everyday English urbanity as dystopian sci-fi. The clanging \u201cI\u2019m Into C.B.,\u201d for example, begins as a cheeky fetishization of trucker culture, before revealing its narrator as a sad-sack, jobless shut-in who uses his radio for devious prankster purposes\u2014an uncanny prophecy of 21st-century online-trolling.", "The arrival of guitarist (and Smith\u2019s future wife) Brix in 1983 didn\u2019t so much change the Fall\u2019s sound as embolden it.

And with Brix dropping shout-\u2019em-out pop hooks like cherries on a mud sundae, the band enjoyed a steady six-record run on Beggars Banquet that yielded their most immediate, enduring songs.

Starting in the \u201990s, the bloated demands of the CD-single took hold, with remixes, live takes, alternate versions, and even Christmas songs starting to appear. They\u2019re emblematic of an era when the Fall seemed to be settling comfortably into middle age, even after Brix departed (she later rejoined) and the band\u2019s revolving door began to swing more vigorously. It was a decade spent embracing trends (see: the Madchester-grooved \u201cTelephone Thing\u201d); flirting with elegantly sung, string-sweetened middle-brow indie (\u201cPopcorn Double Feature\u201d); mashing up reggae standards (\u201cWhy Are People Grudgeful?\u201d); quoting ", " (\u201c15 Ways\u201d); and twisting to golden oldies (\u201cF-\u2018Oldin\u2019 Money\u201d).

The 2004 single \u201cTheme From Sparta F.C. #2\u201d adheres to his tradition of soccer-stadium-worthy chants, but comes as vicious as a pack of marauding hooligans. \u201cReformation!

Most acts still lip-synched on \u201cTOTP,\u201d so this time Somerville focused on performing, rather than sustaining his fierce cri de coeur about pride in the face of a hate crime. With the camera at crotch height, he seduced viewers at home and pointed saucily down the lens, perhaps emboldened by the band\u2019s discovery of the BBC\u2019s alleged basement glory hole toilets, which Bronski claimed to have visited whenever they played \u201cTOTP.\u201d The moment hasn\u2019t been memorialized the same way as Bowie\u2019s iconic visit on the show 12 years earlier, but it had to be a \u201cStarman\u201d revelation for at least a few hundred closeted British kids who couldn\u2019t relate to the more outlandish subversions of masculinity rampaging elsewhere on the show.", "British pop had never been queerer.

Producer Trevor Horn and journalist Paul Morley\u2019s Zang Tuum Tumb had also offered them the treatment that Frankie Goes to Hollywood got when Bronski said no. \u201cMorley\u2019s idea was to have us wear and market t-shirts that basically said that we were gay, because they\u2019d have words like \u2018QUEER\u2019 or \u2018POOF\u2019 printed on them,\u201d said Somerville, who was uninterested in controversy or reductiveness. For Bronski Beat, singing candidly about their sexuality wasn\u2019t a means of provocation, but drawing attention to the still-very-real oppression that pervaded public life under Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government. They valued activism over agitprop, and knew that the personal was political, qualities that made their first two singles their most urgent and enduring.", "\u201dSmalltown Boy\u201d remains a perfect song. It is nimble and crushing, forlorn and relieved, frail yet determined. In just a few lines, Somerville sketches the plight of the young queer kid in suburbia, beaten up by bullies but refusing to cry in front of them; concerned about how his mother will respond to his disappearance, but certain that he has to save himself first. Steinbachek and Bronski briefly slow the tempo, trapping the listener in the sense of purgatory that Somerville distills, but then add a hand-slapped congo that hits like a rush of adrenaline as a new life comes into view. Although Somerville\u2019s liberation is palpable, he\u2019s not interested in happy endings: The song ends with him repeating the line about leaving in the morning \u201cwith everything you own in a little black case,\u201d acknowledging the thousands of young people who would make the very same journey.

Young black men were arrested simply for driving cars (to name just one absurd example), and gay men for embracing in public. Somerville casts the gaze that he would later wield on \u201cTOTP\u201d in two directions, at the perpetrators of hate crimes and criminalization and his lover and brothers in arms. The two sides meet, for a second, in a single glorious line: \u201c", " feel guilty, never give in,\u201d he purrs, a lustful celebration of defiance and desire. Bold horns mirror his raunchy delivery, a whirlwind of ricocheting marimba channeling his exhilaration. But nothing in Steinbachek and Bronski\u2019s arsenal is any match for Somerville\u2019s piercing scream, which demands \u201cWHY?\u201d as if sheer force could elicit the answer.

So Somerville turned his voice into a weapon, a weedy Scottish boy\u2019s superpower that made him seem 100-feet tall. He\u2019s said that his only vocal training was singing along to Donna Summer and Sylvester records. Apparently, this was strong enough to turn a short redhead from Glasgow into a bona fide diva, who recognized the transgressive potential of reclaiming this style from the female singers who made gay culture unthreatening to the mainstream. Not that it stopped Bronski Beat from crashing it, too: \u201cWhy?\u201d peaked at Number 6 in the UK, and \u201cSmalltown Boy\u201d at Number 3.", "Given Somerville\u2019s vocal distinction, it\u2019s strange that Bronski Beat\u2019s subsequent debut, ", ", lacks more of their trailblazing belters.

Bronski Beat were standard-bearers for these causes, speaking out in interviews, performing at benefits, and listing international ages of consent in their record\u2019s liner notes to show how backwards Britain was.

Again, it\u2019s fiercely simple, but Steinbachek and Bronski\u2019s sultry backing makes the allure of these toxic quantities plain, and Somerville\u2019s experiences with sex as currency for survival darken its hue.", "More subversive are Bronski Beat\u2019s songs about desire, each delivered in a distinct feminine mode. \u201cAin\u2019t Necessarily So\u201d is a cover of the Gershwins\u2019 ", " song about doubting the bible\u2014the implication here obviously being its statements on homosexuality\u2014reinterpreted as a slice of sophisticated percolation more akin to fellow 1984 breakout star Sade than gritty British synth-pop. \u201cHeatwave\u201d finds Somerville playing at being Peggy Lee (another of his childhood obsessions), updating \u201cFever\u201d as a steamy come-on fit for the beaches of Fire Island or Venice. It sounds a million miles from London\u2019s dank clubs and Glasgow\u2019s damp streets, a sheer fantasy that makes Somerville an agent of lust, rejecting yearning diva worship with its nose pressed up against the glass.", "*The Age of Consent *ends with Somerville\u2019s ultimate act of centering gay desire, with covers of Donna Summer\u2019s \u201cNeed a Man Blues\u201d and \u201cI Feel Love.\u201d A year earlier, Summer, a born-again Christian, had allegedly denounced her mammoth gay fanbase at a gig in Atlantic City. She would dispute this, but the damage was already done, and gay fans rejected her right back.

An unexplained fallout led Somerville to leave the band in early 1985 and form the Communards with Richard Coles. We can lament the missed opportunity for them to develop their sound together: Steinbachek and Bronski becoming more sophisticated producers, Somerville coming into his power as a vocalist and spokesman alongside his formative allies. But despite the roughness of their debut, they more than fulfilled their function. Bronski Beat formed to play a benefit, raising money for LGBTQ charities\u2019 defense costs. Over the original trio\u2019s year in the public eye, they gave queer kids who were alienated by society and extroverts alike their own subtle form of armor."]},

The gospel boom-bap of the long-winded \u201cAmen (Intro)\u201d is a backdrop for CyHi to paint his origin story in borrowed strokes, comparing himself to Leonardo DiCaprio and Johnny Depp characters just a bar apart. The occasional but persistent corniness of CyHi\u2019s punchline lyricism could be deployed as a sort of barometer amongst hip-hop fans. What do you think when he raps a line like \u201cMy homies was crippin\u2019 so hard, all they eat is seafood\u201d?

Those early tracks are barrage attacks of lyricism, whereas moments like \u201cMovin\u2019 Around\u201d and \u201cTrick Me\u201d cast CyHi as a more than serviceable hook singer.

Later, on \u201cLooking for Love,\u201d CyHi sounds entirely in his range belting out an Autotune tinged hook or leaning in during his verse to croon, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to put some purses on you, girl.\u201d Kanye West tags along on \u201cDat Side\u201d for a wonky banger and the album\u2019s obvious centerpiece moneymaker.", "For all the bases it covers, ", " benefits from swift pacing.

After his verse on the title track, ", " thanks CyHi for granting him the quiet of an inconspicuous feature. \u201cI was tryna\u2019 make it as conversational as possible, \u2018cause it\u2019s just conversation,\u201d the elder emcee says after clocking a gracefully minimal performance.

Melchior\u2019s semi-spoken deadpan\u2014which isn\u2019t far from Spray Paint\u2019s flat shouts\u2014adds to the perpetual motion, but his wry bite is also surprisingly subtle. He\u2019ll repeat a phrase as if photocopying the one before, then alter his tone slightly, poking bubbles of drama through the music\u2019s steely surface. This works best on \u201cReef of Regret,\u201d as Melchior attacks the title from enough angles that the effect is both smoothly hypnotic and oddly disturbing.", "It can be easy, and enjoyable, to settle into Contributors\u2019 grooves as if you\u2019re cruising the Autobahn.

Bathed in intensely psychedelic projections, she\u2019ll lay down thundering rhythm tracks using a floor tom and loop them through pedals, before layering on distorted, disorienting electronics in rhythmic swells. And then she unleashes her most powerful weapon of all: a striking, sonorous, opera-schooled voice that\u2019s part stern school headmaster, part veteran soul diva. On strident early tracks like \u201cSour Paradise\u201d and \u201cOf This Land,\u201d that voice had to bust through the surrounding clamor with the force of a battering ram in order to get their eco-conscious invectives across.

However, at the time, Canada was being weighed down by its own political albatross. Sure, these days, Canada\u2019s universal healthcare system, copious arts funding, and hunky prime minister can make the place seem like a socialist utopia compared to the U.S. But from 2006 to 2015, the country was headed by Stephen Harper, a staunch conservative whose divisive rhetoric, disregard for the marginalized, and single-minded belief in economy over environment provided a sort of soft-launch/focus-group teaser of the turmoil currently infecting the U.S. During Harper\u2019s final year in office, Mackenzie released \u201c", ",\u201d a slow-burning cauldron of bilious spite and barely contained rage directed at the prime minister.

Though built from her trusty toolkit of drums and drones, the recordings rebuild Mackenzie\u2019s wall of sound as a three-dimensional space, bringing greater definition to her melodies and encouraging more subtly soulful vocal performances to better harness the juddering energy of rattling bangers like \u201cFell in a Hole.\u201d A handful of these tracks surfaced in rawer form on Bandcamp or on label compilations over the past couple of years, and the differences are substantial. In its ", ", \u201cThis You Need\u201d drowned its tropical thrust in waves of disembodied voices, with Glynt frantically reading out a list of demands (\u201cI don\u2019t want to just with anyone/But with everyone!\u201d) as if she were about to get swept up in the tide. On the finely chiseled, beat-heavy version that closes out ", ", those words become the song\u2019s climactic, rabble-rousing mantra.", "The production here also emphasizes a quality that could sometimes get obscured in Mackenzie\u2019s sonic assault: joy.

And nowhere is that process more explicit than on the album\u2019s most epic, dramatic track, \u201cThe Cold.\u201d Over the course of almost six slow-roiling minutes, Mackenzie uses her breathy vocals to thaw the song\u2019s icy surface and her jittering drum sticks to break the pieces away, revealing the beating proletariat heart that\u2019s been frozen by the numbing despair these times engender.

Eddy Arnold\u2019s \u201cI Couldn\u2019t Believe It Was True,\u201d a brief, jaunty number, stands in for the moment when the Preacher discovers that his wife has forsaken him. In the next iteration of the recurring theme, \u201cTime of the Preacher,\u201d the recognition of loss sinks in: \u201cAnd he cried like a baby/And he screamed like a panther.\u201d", "Deliberately spare arrangements echoed the Stranger\u2019s existential loneliness. Relying mostly on guitar, piano, and drums, Nelson summoned a small crew of musicians in the studio\u2014his sister, Bobbie Nelson, longtime drummer Paul English, Bucky Meadows, Mickey Raphael, Jody Payne. Little else was needed to evoke the sound of the Preacher\u2019s violent ride, the relentless, loping, strumming gait: \u201cDon\u2019t fight him don\u2019t spite him/Let\u2019s wait till tomorrow/Maybe he\u2019ll ride on again.\u201d The horse in the studio was, of course, Trigger, the Martin guitar Nelson had customized in Nashville a few years earlier, Frankensteined with a pickup from his old Baldwin guitar and named after Roy Rogers\u2019 television horse. Nelson heard Trigger \u201cas a human sound, a sound close to my own voice.\u201d", "Musically, Nelson has always subverted plain, pure song with utter, starlit mystery. He had an uncanny ability to bend the listener\u2019s perception of time. \u201cI could put more emotion in my lyric if I phrased it in a more conversational, relaxed way,\u201d he wrote in 1988. His vocal phrasings snake around the surfaces, altering its inflections, anticipating a beat or falling just behind it; his guitar appears to stretch and shorten the meter without ever breaking it.", "As a single punched into a dusty jukebox, Fred Rose\u2019s \u201cBlue Eyes Crying in the Rain\u201d is a beautifully if painful love song, the harmonies on the line \u201cOnly memories remain\u201d landing with a little sting. Threaded into the Preacher\u2019s story, it becomes the heart of the album. Like Nelson and Trigger lingering on certain phrasings, parsing missed chances and regrets, the Preacher and his black stallion haunt the canyons, retracing steps. He\u2019s mindful that the love he lost is a place to which he can never return, but he can\u2019t stop himself from trying to get back there.", "Country music had always been one of the truest genres, gritty and realistic songs of broken hearts, the farm, the factory, the bottle. But until ", " music critic Chet Flippo wrote in ", " the genre had offered scant escapism and \u201calmost no fantasy.\u201d Nelson, for the first time, allowed country music to dream big and beautiful. Nelson converses with the genre\u2019s roots but sends them into uncharted and previously forbidden territory, fusing his essential influences\u2014the tragic brilliance of Hank Williams and the melodic expression of Django Reinhardt. His anti-heroic story has elements of Homeric myth, a moody, Sergio Leone sensibility, the devastating lyrical force of Cormac McCarthy, whose Border Trilogy ", " in many ways prefigures.", "When he left Nashville for Austin in 1972, Nelson had gladly traded his jackets and ties for bandannas and jeans; he\u2019d grown his own red hair long.

It is possible in 2017, when interpretations still overwhelmingly shrink to the literal-minded, to return there too.", "And yet that would be missing out on so much. Sure, by 1975, Nelson had weathered and been implicated in his own share of stormy relationships, allegedly standing on both sides of infidelity. But to dwell on a reading of ", " primarily as a tale of manhood and waywardness or as one entrenched in bygone notions of America feels dated, particularly if you are anywhere on the margins of that story. Women, empathetic listeners by nature and necessity, learn to be very good at imagining ourselves into narratives framed around the literal experiences of boys and men. And in ", ", the story that resonates loudest is not the most obvious one but a universal one, about what it means, in dark and thrilling ways, to follow your instincts when you have everything at stake and nothing to lose.", "With ", " arguably the biggest artistic gamble of his career, Nelson framed it as an album about creativity and risk, about bad decisions and lonesome paths, about learning to listen to instincts, and, moreover, about distinguishing instinct from impulse. If ", " was Nelson\u2019s newfound manifesto, ", " forged into mythic weirdness acknowledging that this is a kind of wandering that can never end. Such is the nature of the itinerant solitude and perpetual dissatisfaction of the artist\u2014the life that the restless and relentlessly prolific Nelson chose for himself\u2014on the road again.", "As the album draws to a close, after searching in Denver dance halls and in strangers\u2019 arms, the Preacher claims to have found some version of solace and maybe even love, if we can take him at his word. His declaration is followed by one of the album\u2019s wordless instrumentals, quiet and beckoning as a campfire, as Mickey Raphael\u2019s harmonica reverberates and fades out. The memory of the lyrics of the previous song linger like smoke: \u201cI looked to the stars, tried all of the bars/And I've nearly gone up in smoke/Now my hand\u2019s on the wheel/I\u2019ve something that\u2019s real/And I feel like I\u2019m going home,\u201d the Preacher-Stranger had just sung in \u201cHands on the Wheel.\u201d It\u2019s not clear, though, whether he\u2019ll ever truly arrive, or if he\u2019d let himself stay long."]},

A month later, it was joined in the stores by ", ", the second long player from Reading shoegazers ", ". The British producer and DJ Nabihah Iqbal was a child at the time, but her debut album sits on a stylistic shelf between them. ", " is first full-length from Iqbal to not bear her former moniker, Throwing Shade, the modish alter ego that she inhabited from 2009 to mid-2017.", "Iqbal has explained that the decision to do away with the Throwing Shade alias was driven by a desire to stand as a British-Asian artist making music. But the move also feels appropriate on an album where Iqbal rolls back the fashionable club production of her previous work in favor of a sound that is more personal and emotive. Gone are the bleeding-edge electronic beats and globe-trotting influences that Iqbal previously preferred on tracks like \u201chashtag IRL.\u201d In a recent ", ", Iqbal said she avoided listening to new music while working on this album, reflecting instead on the music of her teenage years. She mentions Joy Division and Bauhaus as influences as well as \"", "\" by R & R Zangeshahi, the latter not so much as a sonic marker as for the ", " it brings from the listener.", "The inky hands of Joy Division\u2019s later incarnation as New Order are all over ", ".

This combination, repeated on the album\u2019s best tracks, may not appear particularly original in late 2017, when New Order\u2019s influence is evident in bands from LCD Soundsystem to The Killers. But Iqbal lifts her music into rather more original territory thanks to vocals that borrow from the chiffon singing style of shoegaze acts like Slowdive or The Telescopes, her fusion of two popular musical influences creating something greater than the sum of its parts.", "It helps that Iqbal is a frequently fantastic songwriter. The spaces and separation inherent in the New Order sound mean that there is no room to hide your dirty musical laundry; every component must be finely tuned to work, both individually and as part of the whole. Iqbal pulls off this delicate balancing act with aplomb, packing the album with wonderful instrumental touches, from the chiming guitar intro to \u201cSomething More\u201d to the luminescent bassline that lifts the midsection of \u201cEternal Passion\u201d to the dramatic cymbal crashes on \u201cSaw U Twice.\u201d To this, she adds vocal lines that combine earworm melodies with a road-worn melancholy, transforming lyrics such as  \u201cSaw you on the train/Will I see you again?\u201d (from \u201cSaw U Twice\u201d) into the kind of quotidian lament that is inherent in the most relatable pop music.", "Iqbal\u2019s lyrical skills are particularly prominent on \u201cZone 1 to 6000,\u201d a song that takes the influence of English poets William Blake and Matthew Arnold into the drudgery and release of 21st-century London. The combination of Iqbal\u2019s deadpan delivery, brilliantly evocative synth chords, and lines like, \u201cWe wander through each other's lives/Just like the river's constant flow\u201d make the song a dead ringer for a 2017 \u201c", "\u201d", "When this combination of hooky, relatable songwriting works, ", " delivers some of the finest, most viscerally satisfying electronic pop music of the year. At times, though, Iqbal seems to let her winning formula get away from her. \u201cIn Visions\u201d feels like two entirely separate songs meeting up and not getting along, the vocal sitting on top of the musical bed like a misconstrued mix you wish the DJ would put out of its agony. \u201cEden Piece,\u201d which opens the album, foregoes a proper vocal melody in favor of rather formless \u201coohs\u201d and \u201caahs\u201d and a wandering piano line. \u201cSlowly,\u201d meanwhile, relies almost entirely on the vocal line, supported only by mopey synth chords and the kind of off-putting, twiddling guitar that might adorn a Scorpions B side. It\u2019s a drag, in all senses of the word.", " is not perfect, then, but most New Order albums also contain their fair share of imperfections and missteps (and somehow it makes us love them more). As Throwing Shade, Iqbal was already one of electronic music\u2019s most engaging polymaths, thanks to a resum\u00e9 that included everything from vocalist on SOPHIE\u2019s \u201cLemonade\u201d to a stint as a human rights lawyer.

", " wasn\u2019t one of Reed\u2019s better albums, but the title song got some FM radio play, and the LP hit the Top 10. Given his dicey commercial prospects at the beginning of the decade, Reed could, by mid\u20131975, be called a successful rock star. Which explains why his next choice was so baffling.", " is shrouded in mystery in part because Lou Reed made it alone. The nature of the music didn\u2019t require a studio or an engineer, so he recorded it by himself at his Manhattan loft, working late into the night. Though he put a long series of instruments, filters, and technical specifications on the back cover of the record (\u201cRing Modulator/Octave Relay Jump\u201d; \u201cDistortion 0.02 bass and treble ceilings\u201d), little or none of it had anything to do with the recording. The notes were a prank. The actual recording involved just a couple of amps and guitars with open tunings leaning against them, a few microphones, and a tape machine. When an amp is turned up, the vibration of the sound will stimulate the strings and pickups of a nearby guitar, generating what we all recognize as feedback. The harmonic information of the feedback will have a particular quality that varies along with the tunings, and with two guitars occupying the same space, the interactions between the instruments can create additional harmonics. Reed experimented with settings and guitar placements and then mixed the results into four separate 16-minute pieces, each of which has completely different information happening in each stereo channel.", "Reed\u2019s state of mind and thought process during the recording are not known, since there was no one else around during the recording and Reed himself, addled by chronic abuse of methamphetamine, served as an unreliable narrator (in his biography ", ", Anthony DeCurtis called ", " a \u201chymn to speed\u201d). All of which left an opening for stories to proliferate. In Victor Bockris\u2019 book ", ", Reed is quoted as saying \u201cI put out ", " precisely to put a stop to all of it. It was a giant fuck-you. I wanted to clear the air and get rid of all those fucking assholes who show up and yell \u2018Vicious\u2019 and \u2018Walk on the Wild Side.\u2019\u201d But Reed\u2019s \u201cfuck-you\u201d was more of a defense mechanism. He clearly knew the album would cause a ruckus and some of his actions were antagonistic provocations, such as the legendary liner notes, alternately boastful and incoherent, where he says, \u201cMost of you won\u2019t like this, and I don\u2019t blame you at all. It\u2019s not meant for you.\u201d But deep down, in the heart he protected at all costs and showed to the world only when he was ready, he adored this music. ", " was, for him, a perfect recording, taking his love of noise and drone and musical chaos to its logical endpoint.  In 2007, Reed ", " Pitchfork, \u201cThe myth is sort of better than the truth. The myth is that I made it to get out of a recording contract. OK, but the truth is that I wouldn\u2019t do that, because I wouldn\u2019t want you to buy a record that I didn\u2019t really like, that I was just trying to do a legal thing with. I wouldn\u2019t do something like that. The truth is that I really, really, really loved it.\u201d", "During the mid\u20131970s, Reed famously sparred in print with Lester Bangs, a Velvet Underground superfan who thought Reed was wasting his talent with his new music and was perfectly willing to tell him so to his face. Reed v. Bangs was the Fischer v. Spassky of the rock press\u2019 golden era, two masters in their respective fields matching each other move-for-move. Two key Bangs articles capture Reed during the period. \u201cLet Us Now Praise Famous Death Dwarves\u201d from the March 1975 issue of ", ", is among Bangs\u2019 most famous pieces, and finds him and Reed, both drunk and drug-addled, basically screaming at each other as Bangs tries to get behind the rock star pose. \u201cThe Greatest Album Ever Made,\u201d in the March \u201976 issue, finds Bangs grappling with ", ".", "The title of Bangs\u2019 ", " piece is ironic, though Bangs clearly loved the music. The fact that he couches genuine appreciation in a series of jokes about the record shows that a critical language for appreciating the album didn\u2019t exist in 1975. Even people who might have loved it (and there are very few accounts of anyone praising it at the time, other than Bangs) didn\u2019t know how to explain why it might be good. At the time, with ", " considered only as \u201cthe new Lou Reed album,\u201d it was met with confusion and derision.  Some writers, like John Rockwell for the ", ", took the record seriously and tried to evaluate it on its own merits, but came away puzzled. Writing in the ", ", William Howard called it \u201cAn appalling rip-off.\u201d In their year-end poll, ", " called it the \u201cWorst Album by a Human Being.\u201d", "The record initially sold about 100,000 copies, making it what has to be the best-selling noise music album of all time, but a great many of those copies were quickly returned, and the record was almost immediately removed from stores. After that initial wave of press and puzzlement, ", " was, for many years, mostly forgotten, trotted out periodically for a \u201cworst music of all time\u201d list. Since it didn\u2019t make the \u201980s transition to CD (there was no reason to put it out) it was barely on the radar at all. ", " had become just part of rock lore, a record you heard about, not one you actually heard.", "But something started to happen to ", " over time: a context for understanding and appreciating it began to build up around it. ", ", the unimpeachable aesthetic conscience of the \u201980s, were inspired by the album (you can see the wheels turning in a ", " of a rapt teenaged ", " communing with his copy). Noise was in the air. In 1991, ", ", also beloved by Sonic Youth, put out a live album called ", ", which consisted mostly of 35 minutes of edited feedback and noise. In 1998, Sonic Youth themselves put out an album called ", " that could be heard as a \u201ccover\u201d of ", ", as it was created with a room full of amps and guitars in the throes of feedback. Extreme music from Japan, led by ", "\u2019s project ", ", brought harsh sounds to the CD racks, many of which sounded uncannily derived from ", ". Record collectors with turntables found used vinyl copies of ", " which had never been terribly scarce given the album\u2019s initially huge rate of return. In 2000, ", " was properly issued on CD, with liner notes from ", " critic David Fricke.  And in the final decade of Reed\u2019s life, he performed variations of the core idea of the record as Metal Machine Trio, and the work was scored for acoustic instruments and recorded by the experimental classical ensemble ", ". Reed always said it would find its place, and he was right.", "Reed has said he made ", " for himself, and indulgence is baked into the concept. It\u2019s the sound of electricity falling in love with itself, utterly relentless, a blast of energy that never lets up. On a casual listen, it seems static, like it\u2019s only doing one thing. But the album constantly changes and is never the same from one second to the next. If you hear the music as placid, which is possible at lower volumes, it\u2019s like a waterfall, endless particles of sound-matter crashing down and never landing in the same way twice. If you hear it as violent, which is also possible, it\u2019s like an explosion that\u2019s constantly at the moment of its concussive peak, one that never quite completes itself.", "The key to understanding ", " is its physicality. Reed has underscored its connection to the body, which gives it a \u201cfunctional\u201d utility that separates it from the more cerebral end of experimental composition. He\u2019s right that it\u2019s best experienced on headphones, not just because of the extreme panning but because very few people have a living situation that allows them to blast an hour of noise music over speakers. To walk the streets with ", " playing loudly in your headphones is to bring focus to the present moment. You can feel your pulse quickening slightly because the noise triggers an alert in your body, but you then realize that when your nerves say \u201cdanger,\u201d they\u2019re not always correct. And the hormonal release that comes from experiencing noise can, if you pause to feel it, focus the mind. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to even think when the thing is on,\u201d Reed said in ", ". \u201cIt destroys you. You can\u2019t complete a thought.\u201d You see things and can isolate their shapes and colors while your ears are otherwise engaged in processing this overwhelming abstraction. And part of the masochistic excitement of the record when you listen to it loud is that it not only sounds like something that will damage your hearing, it\u2019s the sound of the damage itself (warning: don't listen to it loud for long).", "\u2019s greatest conceptual tweak might be the fact that it both has \u201can ending\u201d and never ends. After 64 minutes of punishing noise that steers clear of melody and steady rhythm, a bassy rumble enters in its final seconds that sounds almost like percussion. It\u2019s at this instant that the album slips into the circular locked groove created by mastering engineer Bob Ludwig. That rumble, now as fixed and tight enough for a rhythm track sample, goes around and around for as long as you want it to. If you have the vinyl, you can continue to listen to ", " as long as you like, that one bit of sound spinning round and round forever, it's beautiful, and it\u2019s been playing for about 12 minutes as I write this now."]},

These are brazen attempts to capture the zeitgeist, even by U2\u2019s standards. Their combined effect is dire: ", " is the shameless effort of four men in their late 50s to muster a contemporary, youthful sound.", "Of course, the band\u2019s aspirations toward relevance are tempered by a competing pursuit: Here they strive, as usual, to guarantee longevity. They want to seem in touch; they also want to canonize another classic. This, one presumes, accounts for the inclusion of more familiar-sounding U2 barn-burners such as \u201cLove Is Bigger Than Anything in its Way,\u201d which sounds almost exactly like one expects a U2 song with that title would, and lead single \u201cYou\u2019re the Best Thing About Me,\u201d which has already failed to take hold of the popular imagination.", "\u201cThe problem with rock now is that it\u2019s trying to be cool,\u201d Bono said recently. \u201cBut clear thoughts and big melodies\u2014if they come from a true place, they not only capture the instant, they become eternal in a way.\u201d The Edge, meanwhile, said the band was concerned with whether these songs would \u201cbe played by people in a bar in 25 years.\u201d Well, ", " does not much \u201ccapture the instant,\u201d hunger to as it might, and it is safe to assume that while, say, \u201cPride (In the Name of Love)\u201d or \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day\u201d have proven something like timeless, \u201cRed Flag Day\u201d and \u201cThe Showman (Little More Better)\u201d will fall rather short of eternal. \u201cHow long must we sing this song?\u201d Bono asked on \u201cSunday Bloody Sunday\u201d\u2014and they\u2019ve been obliged to sing it nightly since 1983. With these songs, about a single tour should do.", "Despite the blatant bid to sound modish and rejuvenated, U2 cannot help in certain respects but sound the same. Bono still writes Bono-brand howlers: He still lapses into prosaic platitudes (\u201cAre you tough enough to be kind?/Do you know your heart has its own mind?\u201d), moony cliche (\u201cFree yourself to be yourself/If only you could see yourself\u201d), and arena-rock patois (\u201cYou!

It does indeed seem like the product of considerable toil: This thing has been in progress for something like three years now, and between its revisions, reconstructions, and post-election rewritings, it plainly benefits from more attention and effort than any U2 album since ", ". But it\u2019s precisely this manifest ambition that makes ", " dispiriting. The music itself isn\u2019t any better merely because this time around the band actually cares; all the industrious fervor amounts to meager flailing. It\u2019s one thing to fail when you\u2019re phoning it in: You leave hope that you could pull it off if only you tried. It\u2019s quite another to fail when you\u2019re giving it everything."]},

He has a knowing, laconic vocal style, which emerges casually, a self-effacing cloud of smoke. That his often blunt lyrics often play with familiar steal-your-girl subject matter only draws attention to how unorthodox his light-touch vocals and sly flows really are.

On \u201cStarted Off My Day (Hey),\u201d over a creaking beat that channels the feeling of picking sleep from your eyes while stumbling to the kitchen, Valee sketches a sing-song flow pattern, then disrupts it, taking a long pause for effect: \u201cSip syrup, sip syrup, that\u2019s twice a four today/And yesterday.../A eight.\u201d This phrasing\u2014the deliberate use of shrinking lines to a lackadaisical poetic effect\u2014feels central to understanding his unpredictable style.", "This artful composition and the perplexing mood of the production come together to create a tone of total uncertainty.

In \u201cVtl,\u201d he recounts what could be a dramatic story before dismissing it with a typically unbothered shrug, one which could be taken literally or in the meta sense, about his rapping: \u201cPolice pulled over me and I switched topics.\u201d The police are reduced to an irritation on a level slightly below being stuck in an aisle seat on an airplane.", "Throughout his work, this seemingly superficial focus on surfaces, on the tactile and material, set against a musical tone of confusion, simultaneously draws attention to what isn't discussed, to what's happened beyond the trivial.

Which of course makes enjoying the experiences and lighthearted wit of Valee\u2019s day-to-day that much more alluring. His focus on quiet humor and the here-and-now is an anchor of confidence in a troubled world. One compact couplet captures the dynamic of his delightfully, deceptively deep approach to coolly delivered quips in two succinct lines. The order of the two lines reinforce their hierarchical importance to his world: \u201cDid some pretty fucked up stuff, I don\u2019t know why I ain\u2019t in hell yet/I bought my bitch a yorkie pup and she ain\u2019t even clip her nails yet.\u201d"]},

In some cases, these inversions are just fun novelties. In \u201cTemporary Insanity,\u201d Svenonius flips the meaning of impermanence: \u201cI\u2019m temporarily insane since I don\u2019t know when... In the daytime I\u2019m a nutcase/At night I\u2019m a mental disgrace/Been this way my whole life.\u201d", "But more often, the songs on ", " use simple subversion for broader profundity. By changing just one word in a historical adage, Svenonius turns \u201c", "\u201d from a song about ancient times into an anthem for action during dire political eras. \u201cRome wasn't burnt in a day...It took a lot of time; people had to bring their fire,\u201d Svenonius insists. \u201cIt took persistence, it took resistance.\u201d Though the song was written before the 2016 election, it\u2019s easy to hear it as a contemporary call to arms\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s time to take a match!/It\u2019s time to return!\u201d\u2014and a reminder that even our current empire can be conquered if we stick to it.", "As Svenonius fans the flames, these fires are lit by one of the hottest Chain and the Gang lineups so far.

Yet praising experimental music\u2019s rejection of the marketplace clearly falls in line with Svenonius\u2019 political stances. Is he celebrating or mocking? At best, he does both with equal conviction, resolving opposites by fully committing to both sides.", "Still, Svenonius can also pick a team, and throughout ", " he sides with outcasts and nonconformists.

On \u201cDon\u2019t Scare the Ghost Away,\u201d Svenonius encounters a ghost who\u2019s frightened of him, a victim of chronic depression who killed himself and his family. \u201cNow he stalks the Earth trying to hold on to that pain for eternity,\u201d Svenonius sings. \u201cI tried to get near to say, \u2018It\u2019s ok\u2019/But when I got too close, that ghost went away.\u201d It\u2019s a rare sentimental note, and it feels sincere, despite being about someone who doesn\u2019t actually exist.

It\u2019s crisp, precise, and reveals his ability to inhabit classic songs while paying respect to their form.", "There are traditionally three or four different ", " at any given time, depending on the album. His recordings in the \u201900s and \u201910s have attempted to reflect him from as many musical angles as can possibly fit within 70 minutes: R&B, folk, soul, and blues, sometimes interchangeably and sometimes in thoughtful combinations. It is often difficult to determine, in the course of these records, if Morrison\u2019s relentless swerving between genres is part of a meaningful, collagist design, or if it is just him working through familiar modalities. But it\u2019s rarely uninteresting to hear, situated next to each other, a song where Morrison sings as if he\u2019s suspended in the slow-motion whirl of a snow globe, followed by a song where his voice chomps through the heave and shudder of the electric blues.", ", Morrison\u2019s 37th album, is his first full-length studio exploration of the blues, which is surprising if only for how much the blues has figured directly into Morrison\u2019s life. On the album, he covers artists as stylistically diverse as ", ", who pushed the tonal possibilities of the harmonica into unknown, distorted regions in the 1950s, and Sister Rosetta Tharpe, who in the 1930s synthesized the blues into a pop-gospel idiom that prefigured rock\u2018n\u2019roll. \u201cThe thing about the blues is you don't dissect it\u2014you just do it,\u201d Morrison said in a statement that accompanied the record\u2019s announcement. The album does exhibit a kind of automatism, the concept seemingly born out of primal impulse. In its singular focus, ", " resembles the only other studio album in his catalog where he unwaveringly pursued a tangent\u20142006\u2019s ", ", on which he devoted himself to country standards, recording what was essentially a more gnomic version of ", "\u2019 ", ".", "But the territory here is more familiar and immediate to Morrison than the nostalgic and contemplative country-western vistas of ", ". On ", ", Morrison doesn\u2019t reach back through his own music or through the infrastructure of a genre so much as he reaches back and sifts through the texture of his own past. In this way, the album feels more autobiographical than any of Morrison\u2019s more mystically-derived records; it\u2019s a collection of songs that establish a narrative of Morrison\u2019s personal relationship with music, of how he discovered the dimensions of his own voice through blues, early rock\u2018n\u2019roll, and soul. Even at the age of 72, Morrison has some of that electricity he must have felt when he first started imitating these songs as a teenager, assembling his voice through listening to and simulating ", " records until it began to sound harsh, percussive, slippery, tending to swim between notes instead of hitting them precisely, but also making every syllable sound as if they were drawn up from a great inner distance, like a stone rescued from the bottom of the ocean.", "Morrison\u2019s covers on ", " express themselves primarily in the language of Chicago electric blues\u2014that heavy ", " lurch, the guitar tones gnarled and internally knotted.

Where a younger Morrison fills up the song with restless syllabic inventions (\u201cIf you ever...change your mind...about leaving-uh, leaving-uh me behind-uh!\u201d), contemporary Morrison slides through the song with the unconscious ease and familiarity with which one might navigate through the furniture in the dark. \u201cI gave you everything, everything I had in the bank,\u201d he sings, his vocal ability considerably narrowed, but also still containing so much of the atomic instability that formed it in the first place. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for you, time for you to say thanks.\u201d The lyric is a pocket of mental weather Morrison inhabits comfortably, to the point where it seems identical to the one that produces his innumerable songs about getting ripped off by the record industry, the air filled as much with conspiracy as fraternity.", "But the most thrilling moment on the record is when its volume suddenly drops for \u201cGoin\u2019 to Chicago,\u201d so that it sounds as if Morrison, Georgie Fame, and Chris Hill\u2014who plucks the walking bassline which forms the song\u2019s spine\u2014are exchanging simple melodic ideas in the uncrowded air.

He seemed to have decided early on that he was going to make it virtually impossible for the music industry and culture\u2019s gatekeepers to miss him. Extroverted without mania, likable but thoughtful, swaggering but goofy, confident but mildly self-deprecating, he grinned and mugged and belly-laughed and said \u201cyes\u201d to everything with such vigor that he cratered into the heart of Middle America.

From then on, their ascent was quiet and frictionless: their record label Jive sent them to London to hole up in a hotel to record their follow-up. They worked tirelessly, with Jeff mostly confined to his hotel because of a cast covering his leg from a car accident back in Philly. Before Jive approached, the two of them had been hashing out material for a DJ album, and Jeff suggested they combine those cuts with the new music and voila: rap\u2019s first double album. It was an inauspicious creation myth, and when they finished, they packed up, came home, and immediately went on the Run\u2019s House tour alongside Whodini, ", "., ", ", and ", ".", "Amid these heavyweights, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince were decidedly the underdogs, the cheerful kids along for the ride.

", " would eventually go on to sell three million copies.", "There were some subterranean industry shifts rumbling just beneath them that no doubt boosted the album\u2019s velocity. The business of hip-hop was shifting solidly from fast-and-cheap singles to album formats, which meant that major labels could\u2014and did\u2014carpet-bomb the box stores of America with their products. Hip-hop was also entering its first widely acknowledged Golden Age, with ", ", ", ", Public Enemy, and ", " filling out rap\u2019s first real popular-culture Mount Rushmore. \u201cRap is in a phase in which it is simultaneously acceptable to the companies running the show, the artists making the music and the audience out there buying it,\u201d Peter Watrous shrewdly observed for the ", " in June of 1988, just as the album was released. The ground was softened for something as transparent, likable, and immediate as DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince.", "With Smith mugging to the very last cheap seat in the rafters and Townes quietly cutting up records with blinding virtuosity, it was guaranteed that at least half of the duo would nullify some of your reservations. If you were leery of hip-hop because you were A) old, B) white, or C) both, Smith was a one-man disarmament machine. If on the other hand, you were a hardcore hip-hop fan, busy memorizing the meter of Rakim\u2019s lines the year he laid them on wax, then Jeff\u2019s pyrotechnics allowed you to swallow Smith\u2019s antics. He was the DJ, Smith was the rapper.", "Smith, understandably, hasn\u2019t been cited much for lyricism or for influence as an MC. He\u2019s also been the subject of multiple ghostwriting allegations, although Nas, frequently cited as a writer for Smith, has vigorously denied it. But he remains a genial and effective rapper, a guy you recognize from the second he opens his mouth. He flowed like a Saturday-morning-cartoon version of Big Daddy Kane or KRS, with compound rhymes and sentences that flowed over line breaks to slyly draw your attention to the tricks he was playing: \u201cIt was kind of an accident, the way that it happened/One day I was rapping, and on the beat Jeff was backing/Me up, and all of a sudden, he brought in a cut/And I dropped my microphone and said, \u2018What the\u2014?\u2019\u201d He rapped on \u201cBrand New Funk.\u201d", "It was nothing that wasn\u2019t being done already by Rakim and Kane and other bolder innovators, but Smith injected the sunbeam of his personality into it. Has anyone ever chuckled mid-flow more convincingly than Smith? His voice is clear and chipper, with every single word as audible and legible on first listen as ten-foot high neon-green graffiti letters. He grinned into fisheye lenses in his videos, full of puppet-show props and sped up, Looney Tunes-style antics. A young Marshall Mathers might have been absorbing every word of LL Cool J\u2019s records at the time, but there\u2019s no question, looking at Eminem\u2019s breakthrough videos for \u201cMy Name Is\u201d and \u201cThe Real Slim Shady,\u201d that the Fresh Prince\u2019s \u201cfriendly scamp\u201d presentation resonated somewhere in his subconscious.", "There are a couple of troublesome reminders in Smith\u2019s lyrics of just how hard it is to remain in the perceived \u201cmiddle,\u201d or rather reminders that \u201cthe middle\u201d is simply a peephole for what those pushing on either side allow you to see. Did you remember, for instance, that one of the punchlines in \u201cParents Just Don\u2019t Understand\u201d is Will Smith almost having sex with a twelve-year-old? Or that he shouts out \u201call the homeboys that got AIDS be quiet\u201d as a way of getting the crowd to cheer on \u201cLive At Union Square, November 1986?\u201d This was right around the height of the AIDS epidemic, but popular awareness of AIDS was years away from critical mass, so the joke dinged off American consciousness like a Nerf bat. In 2017, it feels like a bludgeon.", "When the duo blew up, they were in fact widely derided as the hip-hop equivalent of Nerf bats. \u201cThat\u2019s when we started hearing, \u2019Aw, man, that shit\u2019s for the suburbs,\u2019 Townes remembered. \u201cI\u2019m sitting there thinking, \u2018Southwest Philly is so far from the suburbs. You have no idea the shit I\u2019ve seen or have gone through\u2026\u2019 I paid very close to attention to that. We were cool as long as we stayed on black radio and stayed amongst our hip-hop peers.\u201d", "It\u2019s understandable that Townes would bristle. With his sterling hip-hop credentials, he was quietly doing brilliant things on those supposed harmless and flyweight songs. On \u201cBrand New,\u201d he cuts up a drum and horn break from Pleasure\u2019s \u201cBouncy Lady,\u201d speeding it and warping it until it sounds like a crumpled-up ball of paper. On \u201cLet\u2019s Get Busy Baby\u201d he isolates a little hiccup in the rising sunbeam of Stevie Wonder \u201cSir Duke\u201d horn lick, and builds a little burbling 8-bit Atari groove from it. On \u201cTime To Chill,\u201d he broke down a flip of George Benson at a time when almost no one in hip-hop was reaching for satiny-smooth, plush samples. This was the age of Public Enemy\u2019s Bomb Squad air-raid squeals, the stark, hard drum breaks of Eric B, but on \u201cParents Just Don\u2019t Understand,\u201d he cut up a chuckling little burble from a Peter Frampton song and turned it into a five-minute long Whoopie Cushion. He\u2019s a genius, alternately working in plain sight and hidden comfortably there, where he\u2019s remained for decades, allowing Will Smith to soak up the spotlight. There is perhaps no old-school hip-hop legend in history with a savvier or more comfortable relationship to fame than Jeffrey Townes.", "Meanwhile, by 1990, Smith had blown through a million dollars, an unfortunate occupational hazard for a rich teenager. While hip-hop was scaling up and outward around him, he found himself in debt and on the precipice of fading into the history books along with all his firsts. So, looking for a way forward, he signed on with producer Quincy Jones and a TV writer named Andy Borowitz for a pilot about a young West Philly youth who moved in with his rich relatives in Bel Air. He and Jazzy Jeff knocked out the theme song more or less overnight, and a pilot was made. The pilot did well: as Borowitz remembered, years later: \u201cThe audience loved Will right from the start.\u201d"]},

Now 25, she is a fairly young songwriter, but not quite as young as her characters, who do not always know how to handle themselves. To occupy their thoughts, she slips into her speaking voice, whispers wordy internal monologues, over-divulging, withdrawing into generalities, plunging back into the messy entanglements of it all.

Written and recorded in the aftermath of a cycling accident that left songwriter Emily Sprague temporarily partially paralyzed, the record captures the discomfort of unfamiliar terrain navigated not by choice but by necessity. Unable to play guitar, Sprague wrote most of the album using keyboards, which form the foundation for the record\u2019s claustrophobic first half. It\u2019s an album of detachment and longing, one which evokes the feeling of being held prisoner in your own broken body.", "For their second album, ", ", Florist have returned to their comfort zone, the sort of hushed, bedroom folk pop Sprague has been steadily refining ever since she started recording songs as a teenager. But this time, everything feels animated by a newfound clarity and focus. The band\u2014which includes Jonnie Baker and Rick Spataro\u2014has stripped their sound to its essence: finger-picked guitar lines, yearning vocal melodies, the soft shuffle of brushed drums. They\u2019ve done away with embellishments like tape hiss and sing-alongs, and now the production feels at once more crisp and intimate.", "At the center of Florist\u2019s spartan sound, Sprague is a lyricist who always sounds like a wise-beyond-her-years naturalist\u2014a sort of upstate New York ", " in training. But here she claims that role with a previously unseen authority and purpose. When struggling to make sense of a parent\u2019s death, she seeks solace in nature\u2019s logic; when faced with everyday struggles, she finds comfort in the smallness of human affairs. There\u2019s a timeless quality to these songs that makes them feel unmoored from the current moment, a reminder that this too will pass. But Sprague still has an empathetic embrace waiting for anyone who\u2019s trying to cope during difficult times. \u201cIf you\u2019re terrified of living, like me, I hope you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she sings on \u201dBlue Mountain Road,\u201d \u201cCause we\u2019re terrified together, in this terrifying time.\u201d", "Like Elverum, Sprague has a tendency to cut the most direct path as a lyricist.

This directness can be disarming, like on \u201cEyes in the Sun,\u201d where she asks, point blank, \u201cDo you wanna join the road of my life?\u201d She then lays it all out in just a few lines, like her hopes and fears are two sides of the same coin: \u201cIt\u2019s been a while but I\u2019m not afraid/Of the things that make me feel something big/Like looking at your eyes in the sun/Like looking at your eyes in the dark.\u201d", "While many of these songs could be described as minimal, they\u2019re also musically rich. Round chords ring and synths twinkle on \u201cGlowing Brightly,\u201d as Sprague thumbs through the faded snapshots in her head. On the title track, the band wraps up Sprague\u2019s gentle voice in a warm cocoon of sound. \u201cBlue Mountain Road\u201d opens with distant noises that bring to mind the sound of a freight train while \u201cInstrumental 3\u201d feels like the music you might put on in the drawing room of a creaky old house in an attempt to lure out the ghosts. Nearly all of these songs are driven by guitar lines that are simple yet memorable, a perfect match for Sprague\u2019s earnest, plainspoken profundity.", "The concept of mindfulness has become something of a trend lately, peddled by meditation apps, self-help books, and yoga classes as an antidote to the ills of an over-connected life. But a state of mind isn\u2019t something that can be bought, it\u2019s something that has to be earned. Sprague seems to understand this; her hard-won superpower is an ability to communicate to us the beauty and value of things that we often overlook. On these songs, she often cuts through the mind\u2019s noise to focus on what\u2019s right in front of her: a beam of light, a lover\u2019s eyes, the worn texture of a cherished memory. This focus seems to have only intensified following her accident and recovery. In this regard, she brings to mind the late Mark Linkous of ", ", who, following his own brush with death, returned to his craft more present and attuned to the living things around him. Like Sparklehorse\u2019s music, ", " has the power to transform your outlook and change the trajectory of your day, if you will let it.", "The album\u2019s arresting closer, \u201cRed Bird,\u201d appears here in the original demo form that Sprague recorded and played for her mother on the day before she died. But even without knowing this fact, the song captures your attention. There\u2019s something intangible and powerful at the core of it, a force you can\u2019t quite put your finger on but which can move you to tears all the same. Sprague traces a delicate, lilting melody with her voice as strings quiver like leaves behind her, summoning a sense of longing that feels ancient and deep. Birds have always embodied nature\u2019s wisdom in Florist\u2019s songs and here they provide comfort, a stable force in the face of impermanence and loss. \u201cI understand the birds now that I\u2019ve learned some things,\u201d Sprague sings in the song\u2019s final moments.

Salvant\u2019s delicate phrasing reveals her penchant for drama on the 1933 standard.

Her clever reworking of N\u00f6el Coward\u2019s \u201cMad About the Boy\u201d also reveals her talent for reinterpretation, the way that she fully embraces a standard, like wearing the clothes of an old lover. As pianist Aaron Diehl lurks about, establishing the dark mood with a spare refrain, the ominous tone becomes wonderfully juxtaposed against Coward\u2019s song of infatuation. Salvant takes full advantage of that fact as she rather unexpectedly, and angrily, belts out \u201cMad!

Iovine nagged Lynch to break free from his style of playing to the point that he actually quit the band (and was coaxed back by Petty).

Petty did not boast Smith\u2019s or Springsteen\u2019s poetic inclinations but offered a variation on a spoken/sung verse. The shift from his laconic, stonerish Southern drawl on the verses to the in-the-red adenoidal yawp on the chorus is still thrilling, and peaks at the last word of the middle-eight, when he shreds his vocal cords before Campbell\u2019s solo: \u201cOne of those things you gotta feel to be truuuuuue!\u201d", "Like most rock lyrics, \u201cRefugee\u201d is best read as a composite of ideas and characters.

Ever the traditionalist, Petty was a fan of \u201950s throwback and CBGBs mainstay Mink DeVille, and on the verses of \u201cGirl,\u201d he tweaks the speak-sing into the dejected persona of a hard-luck nobody, a worn-down iteration ", " archetype. Petty\u2019s voice morphs into a rasp on the pre-chorus, before coming to full bloom on the chorus, when the streetwise greaser lapses into a romantic stupor at the mere sight of his beloved. Petty\u2019s dead-on imitation of Roger McGuinn\u2019s gentle tenor is backed by Tench drizzling piano notes on one edge of the song and holding a sustained, dreamlike organ chord on another. Petty\u2019s career is defined by his mastery of effortlessly pretty medium-tempo grooves, and the \u201cGirl\u201d chorus stands out among them: It\u2019s both the most genuinely sweet and unexpectedly psychedelic moment in Petty\u2019s extensive canon of hooks.", "Speaking of choruses, is there a single six-word phrase more humbly aligned with rock\u2019s zero-to-hero mythos than, \u201cEven the losers get lucky sometimes\u201d?

This album offers little beyond its surface, though that surface is crafted with capable efficiency. What\u2019s missing are those idiosyncrasies which suggest an artist honing his voice, pushing himself into more uncomfortable places, channeling his curiosity in the pursuit of a new creative path, or simply broadening his range by experimenting with the genre\u2019s wide toolkit. These come with experience and applied passion. He\u2019s a new artist, young and unproven, but he\u2019s built a large audience.

The spot where disgust turns seductive, where rot becomes ferment\u2014this is his home. Everything we find truly sexy as adults, after all, repulses us as children, and the sour atmosphere of the music seems to come from this place: the realization that maybe some revolting experiences have subsidiary benefits. \u201cSlipping into filth/Lonely but surrounded/A new place to drown/Six feet beneath the moon,\u201d he has his dad recite on \u201cBermondsey Bosom (Right).\u201d He sounds peaceful, even gentle.

The 17-minute long \u201cThe Code of Interdependence\u201d wanders far and wide, cohering at points but mostly just venturing to the furthest extremes of the Moog for signs of life. For those looking for the most cosmic part of Sun Ra\u2019s sound, the 18-minute \u201cSpace Probe\u201d is near legendary. It\u2019s Sun Ra operating solo, exploring the wooliest voids of space with the Moog as his craft, tuning into the most alien of frequencies and making them heel to his command.

The Jam, on the other hand, helped establish the revolutionary idea that there was a British rock & roll tradition to be upheld\u2014a notion that became rock sacrament, with a legion of bands mimicking the Jam\u2019s \u201960s mod revivalism by the close of the \u201970s.

Yet despite the Jam\u2019s evident love of yesterday, they managed to dodge the usual pitfalls of nostalgia. Weller listened to new music alongside his old favorites, getting turned on not just by the Sex Pistols, but by the hard, clean attack of Dr. Feelgood, the Canvey Island renegades who made traditional values seem lethal. The Jam followed suit, pushing so hard that even the rare ballad on their first two albums\u2014such as the aching \u201cAway From the Numbers\u201d\u2014twitches like a live wire.", "The Jam would soon expand their range, with Weller sharpening his observational eye on 1978\u2019s ", " and the group leaving punk definitively behind on 1979\u2019s ", ", but the fevered concentration they had in their first year is intoxicating.

The circular vamping serves as a kind of scene-setting, building energy without arriving at any particular destination; swelling synth pads and lilting tambourine amplify the sense of drift. \u201cRah-Rah\u201d picks up the same palette and adds trickling liquids, Hammond flutter, and guttural chants, for a skipping house groove that only hits cruising altitude in its final minute.", "With the third track, \u201cBack Tuck Basket Toss,\u201d Juju & Jordash ease into the syncopated chords of piano house (and, for fun, some gnarly digital slap bass). It\u2019s the record\u2019s clubbiest cut yet, even though it\u2019s slower than the two that have preceded it. The album\u2019s sequencing follows a curious organizing principle: Each successive track across the first half of the album is slower than the last. The effect is not so much to lessen the energy level as to darken the mood and deepen the intensity of every pulse, and with the following track, \u201cDeadman,\u201d things get truly entrancing. There\u2019s a hint of a talking drum in the toms; a low wind blows through the track\u2019s ample empty space.

Here, and across the album, they flex those chops brilliantly.", "The tempos bottom out with \u201cPaper Dolls\u201d and \u201cHanging Pyramid,\u201d a pair of tracks that hover around the 90-BPM mark, and which collectively comprise the record\u2019s beating heart. \u201cPaper Dolls\u201d plays highlife-inspired guitar off delicately detuned synthesizer, and its triplet pulse lends to a dizzy sort of slow/fast quality, while \u201cHanging Pyramid,\u201d the album\u2019s most unassuming cut, applies double-time pulses to a barely-there array of marimba and handclaps, like a drum \u2018n\u2019 bass remix of ", ". Both are dazzlingly pointillistic. The remaining three tracks build up the energy once more, but it\u2019s here at the album\u2019s cavernous center that the duo's skills shine brightest, as they carefully (but never fussily) polish their sounds to a dull gleam, weaving everything into a loose lattice of pluck and ping. Keeping one finger on the pulse without ever submitting entirely to it, they highlight the tension between the rhythmic grid\u2014rigid, unrelenting\u2014and the slipperiness of the objects that pass through it.

Morrissey further suggests to Prince Charles that it would be a lark if he cross-dressed in his mother\u2019s wedding clothes and posed on the front page of the right-wing, royals-obsessed newspaper ", ". The absurdist fantasia of Morrissey\u2019s lyric recalls the black comedies of \u201960s gay playwright Joe Orton, in which every kind of conventional propriety is riotously inverted.

Originally the flipside to \u201cBoy With the Thorn,\u201d \u201cRubber Ring\u201d gets its name from the life-preservers you find on ships. Although his songs once saved their lives, Morrissey anticipates his fans abandoning him as they grow out of the maladjustment and amorous ineptitude in which he will remain perpetually trapped. The empty young lives will fill up with all the normal sorts of happiness, he predicts, and the Smiths records will be filed away and forgotten. \u201cDo you love me like you used to?\u201d Morrissey beseeches, as if he\u2019s actually in a real romance with each and every one of his fans, acutely aware of the perversity and impossibility at work in pop\u2019s psycho-dynamics of identification and projection.", "Two other loose categories could be formed out of the songs on ", ": Beside the meta, there\u2019s the merry and the melancholy. Despite the morbid (and misspelled) title, \u201cCemetry Gates\u201d is sprightly and carefree. Even though they\u2019re strolling among the gravestones quoting poetry at each other to show how intensely they feel the sorrow of mortality, the life-force is strong in these precocious youngsters. As so often with Morrissey, the frissons come with the tiny quirks of unusual word-choice or phrasing\u2014the little jolt of the way he pronounces \u201cplagiarize\u201d with an incorrect hard \u201cg,\u201d for instance. Featuring the album\u2019s second instance of cross-dressing, \u201cVicar in a Tutu\u201d is a slight delight with just a casual twist of subversiveness in a passing reference to the priest\u2019s kinky antics being \u201cas natural as rain\u201d: This freak is just as God made him. Almost cosmic in its insubstantiality, \u201cSome Girls Are Bigger Than Others\u201d seemed at the time an anticlimactic ending to such an Important Album. Now I think the understatement is just right, rather than the obvious curtain-closer, \u201cThere Is a Light That Never Goes Out\u201d\u2014the glide and glisten of Marr\u2019s playing on \u201cSome Girls\u201d ", " that never-fading light.", "And then there\u2019s the life-and-death serious stuff. Both songs of unrequited love, \u201cI Know It\u2019s Over\u201d and \u201cThere Is a Light\u201d make a pair: The first spins majesty out of misery, the second transcends it with a sublime and nakedly religious vision of hope-in-vain as an end in itself.  The writing in \u201cI Know It\u2019s Over\u201d is a tour de force, from the opening image of the empty\u2014sexless, loveless\u2014bed as a grave, through the suicidal inversions of \u201cThe sea wants to take me/The knife wants to slit me,\u201d onto the self-lacerations of \u201cIf you\u2019re so funny, then why are you on your own tonight?\u201d and finally the unexpected and amazing grace of \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to hate/It takes strength to be gentle and kind.\u201d Not a strong or sure singer by conventional standards, Morrissey gives his all-time greatest vocal performance, something ear-witness Johnny Marr described as \u201cone of the highlights of my life.\u201d", "As for \u201cThere Is a Light\u201d\u2014if you don\u2019t tear up at the chorus, you belong to a different species. The scenario involves another doomed affair, a love (and a life\u2014Morrissey\u2019s) that never really started. But here Morrissey hovers in an ecstatic suspension of yearning that becomes its own satisfaction, an emptiness that becomes a plenitude. The greatest of his many songs about not belonging anywhere or to anyone, it so very nearly tumbles into comedy (and there are those who\u2019ve laughed) with the melodramatic excess of its image of the double-decker bus and the romantic entwining-in-death of the not-quite-lovers. But the trembling sincerity of \u201cthe pleasure, the privilege is mine\u201d keeps it on the right side of the gravity/levity divide in the Smiths songbook.", "Marginally more robust and shiny than the last time it was remastered, this new ", " comes with a couple of extra discs and a DVD that contains a promo directed by British filmmaker Derek Jarman. The demos contain differences that will interest the diehards. \u201cNever Had No One Ever,\u201d the album\u2019s one real dud, is enhanced by an unlikely trumpet solo and some strange moaning from Moz. Elsewhere, you hear the singer trying out different word-choices and phrasings: The demo of \u201cI Know It\u2019s Over\u201d lacks the \u201coh, mother\u201d address and its bed is \u201cicy\u201d not \u201cempty.\u201d For those who like that sort of thing, there\u2019s a live album, recorded in Boston in August 1986. Having seen them twice in their quasi-imperial prime, I never thought the Smiths were that potent as a live band: The delicate flower of Marr\u2019s playing fared better in the studio, Morrissey\u2019s voice strained to compete with amplified music, and the electricity came mostly from the audience\u2019s ardour.", "Being a Smiths fan during the band\u2019s actual lifetime felt like an aesthetic protest vote signaling your alienation from both the \u201980s pop mainstream and the political culture it reflected. As that context drops away with the passage of the decades, what endures is the peal of exile in Morrissey\u2019s voice, a timeless plaint of longing and not-belonging. Without Morrissey\u2019s tart wit and strange mind, Marr can be merely pretty, as shown by the instrumental B-sides of this era. Equally, without Marr\u2019s beauty, Morrissey can be unbearable (as much of his post-Smiths career bears out). But when Morrissey\u2019s sighs are caressed by Marr\u2019s serene, synthesized strings on \u201cThere Is a Light,\u201d or when the singer\u2019s wordless falsetto flutters amid the guitarist\u2019s golden cascades in \u201cBoy with the Thorn,\u201d there\u2019s something miraculous about the way their textures mesh. It\u2019s a great musical tragedy that barely a year after releasing ", ", this odd couple went their separate ways, for reasons that still feel not fully explained.

Call it the \u201cUncast Shadow of a Northern Myth.\u201d", "But from this widescreen, Oscar-worthy vantage, ", " zeroes in on the minutiae and malcontent of modern life. There\u2019s the bleary, bloodshot-visioned misfit of \u201cEyeballs\u201d who\u2019s afraid of losing his (presumably California-bound) girlfriend to \u201cjuicing\u201d and \u201cjogging,\u201d or the downcast narrator of \u201cIndian Style\u201d who\u2019s sending apologies by text message. On these winsome turns, Savage\u2019s drawl works within a limited range of sing-speak, but it\u2019s far from a blunt, deadpan instrument\u2014it quavers with both charming self-deprecation and genuine ache. And the calmer he gets, the more heartfelt he sounds: the ambient electrical-storm crackle of the eerily still \u201cWild, Wild, Wild Horses\u201d only makes his plainspoken declarations of devotion sound more resolute, like someone standing their ground in a windswept open field even as the flickers of lightning in the distance creep perilously closer.", "In moments like these, ", ", in its own peculiar way, speaks soundly to our current condition\u2014that, in the face of all the unrelenting awfulness playing out in our newsfeeds on a daily basis (and the paralyzing sense of helplessness it engenders), all you can do is hold onto your loved ones a little tighter. Or, of course, there\u2019s always drinking. On the epic \u201cLadies From Houston,\u201d Savage slowly sashays through a series of party conversations with ", " elegance, before talk eventually turns to a certain \u201ctelevised demon\u201d and \u201cthe sadness I feel when he pollutes the screen.\u201d He opts to drown his despair in a discarded half-empty beer can \u201cso it doesn\u2019t get wasted.\u201d", "But ", " doesn\u2019t always navigate the world with such humility and grace: the bluesy grind \u201cWhat Do I Do\u201d alternates between existential koans and cathartic blasts of spark-shooting guitar squall, however, the song has already hammered its point three minutes into its eight-minute lurch. And the closing title track is less the album\u2019s grand finale than its battle royale, with Savage\u2019s mind bouncing between sentiments both personal (\u201cI need you wildly as the blue jay needs a tune it can sing into the afternoon\u201d) and political (\u201cMost religion is as far from faith/As the sun is from the shadows it shapes\u201d). Shifting abruptly between a downhome ", " groove, solitary electric-folk serenades, a loopy piano-pounded reprise of \u201cEyeballs,\u201d and a Wurlitzer-powered riff on \u201cHouse of the Rising Sun,\u201d the song is a would-be honky-prog ", " suite, albeit with adjoining screws left purposely loose.", "But just as ", " did on \u201cThe End,\u201d Savage leaves us with a peaceful closing meta commentary: \u201cOf all the pieces I\u2019ve combined/Still the cruelest mixture yet/Is the softness of the thawing dawn and the hardness of regret.\u201d Accordingly, in its wobbly balance of tender introspection and topical exposition, ", " is a handy guide for keeping your cool as the world degenerates into a hot mess."]}
